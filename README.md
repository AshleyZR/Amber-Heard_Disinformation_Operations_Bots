# Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots
<b><i>Social Network Analysis of Disinformation/Influence Operations and Bots</i> Cross-Platforms on <i>Amber Heard</i>. 
<br>Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, Change.org, and Facebook for <i>6 Social Media Platforms</i>.</b>

<i><b>Millions of Texts and Accounts were studied for Social Network Analysis.</b></i>

We're Worldwide Independent Researchers with over 20 data analysts, scientists, and observers analyzing this data for over a year. Research and development is ongoing, and this public operation spanning for years continues. We invite researchers and students to study this case example. 

Data collected on Amber Heard is primarily related to the years 2018-2021, ongoing into 2022. 

This is the most detailed public analysis of a disinformation operation and the most voluminous yet - showing the impact of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-breakout-scale-measuring-the-impact-of-influence-operations"><i>Category 6</a> influence.</b></i> This work is in-progress and prepared for peer-review. 

<b>Our Purpose is to create precedents and foundations to help other victims of cyberabuse, bots, domestic abuse, <a href="https://www.connecticutprotectivemoms.org/coercive-control-legislation-in-the">coercive control</a>, hostile environments, and Disinformation Operations</b>. 
<br>We want to save lives and help partners create systems to help online - including specialized and accurate rescue, quality custom studies, data analysis, Social Network Analysis, forensics, research, situation awareness, and rescue/public safety technologies - <i>with focus on the victim primarily and <b>her environment</b></i>.

<b>Collaboration:</b> <br>
If you're a social enterprise, researcher, organization, student, or academic helping female victims of abuse, coercive control, domestic abuse, bots, harassment, or hostile environments - we welcome partnership with you. 
<br>Our studies and data can be used for Social Network Analysis, Data Analysis, machine learning, Natural Language Processing, artificial intelligence, Data Science labeling, anti-abuse, rescue projects, anti-crime, timelines, OSINT, simulations, and monitoring systems to help other victims and their lives. 
<br><br>Since this data is high volume about domestic abuse and gender, with an actress and film industry element, it's highly relevant for classification and data science projects on those topics.
<br><i>Please contact us for data and code.</i>
<br><br>
<b>Although it's abuse of process, <a href="https://www.connecticutprotectivemoms.org/coercive-control-legislation-in-the">coercive control</a> is becoming illegal in more countries and states/provinces worldwide.</b>
- <i>If you're a victim needing help against cyberabuse especially in <a href="https://safeescape.org">online domestic abuse</a> and <a href="https://metta-space.com">hostile environments</a>, please contact us.</i><br>

<b>Do No Harm:</b> <br>
All collaborators, researchers, and observers are required to sign, acknowledge, agree to "Do No Harm" agreements. If you are one of the victims listed in this study and need harmful material removed or to collaborate with us, please contact us.
<br><br>We do not include the code or full data to protect individuals in this study and to prevent harmful operations. As a precedent, other researchers and students should use this GitHub and study as a basis for their own social network analysis projects. We draw attention to this project months before in-person appearances for safety.

"Category One operations only spread within one community on one platform, while Category Two operations either spread in one community across multiple platforms, or spread across multiple communities on one platform. Category Three operations spread across <i>multiple social media platforms and reach multiple communities.</i> 
 <br>Category Four operations break out from social media completely and are amplified by <i>mainstream media</i>, while Category Five operations are amplified by <i>high-profile individuals</i> such as celebrities and political candidates. 
 <i><br>An IO reaches <b>Category Six</b> if it triggers a policy response or some other form of concrete action, or if it includes <b>a call for violence.</i></b>"
