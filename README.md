We're an Independent Research Team with over 20 data analysts, scientists, and observers analyzing this data for over a year. Research and development continues, and this public operation spans for years. We invite researchers to study this case example. 
<br>Data collected on Amber Heard is primarily related to the years 2018-2021. We studied millions of texts and accounts for <b>Social Network Analysis.</b>

This work is in-progress and prepared for peer-review.
