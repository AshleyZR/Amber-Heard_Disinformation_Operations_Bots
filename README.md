<b><i>Social Network Analysis of Disinformation/Influence Operations and Bots</i> Cross-Platforms on <i>Amber Heard</i>. 
<br>Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, Change.org, and Facebook or for <i>6 Social Media Platforms</i>.</b>

We're Worldwide Independent Researchers with over 20 data analysts, scientists, and observers analyzing this data for over a year. Research and development continues, and this public operation spans for years which continues. We invite researchers and students to study this case example. 

<i>A study of Millions of Texts and Accounts for <b>Social Network Analysis.</b></i>
<br>Data collected on Amber Heard is primarily related to the years 2018-2021, ongoing into 2022. 

This work is in-progress and prepared for peer-review. This is the most detailed public anaysis of a disinformation operation and the most volumnious yet, showing the impact of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-breakout-scale-measuring-the-impact-of-influence-operations"><i>Category 6</a> influence.</b></i>

<b>Our Purpose is to create foundations and precedents to help other victims of cyberabuse, bots, domestic abuse, <a href="https://www.connecticutprotectivemoms.org/coercive-control-legislation-in-the">coercive control</a>, hostile environments, and Disinformation Operations</b>. 
<br>We want to save lives and help partners create systems to help save lives online - including specialized and accurate rescue, quality custom studies, data analysis, Social Network Analysis, forensics, research, situation awareness, and rescue/public safety technologies - <i>with focus on the victim primarily and <b>her environment</b></i>.

<b>Collaboration:</b> <br>
If you're a social enterprise, researcher, organization, student, or academic helping female victims of abuse, coercive control, domestic abuse, bots, harassment, or hostile environments, we welcome partnership with you to create Social Network Analysis, data analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, OSINT, rescue, and monitoring systems to help other victims and their lives. 
<br><i>Please contact us for data and code.</i>
<br><br>
<b>Although it's abuse of process, <a href="https://www.connecticutprotectivemoms.org/coercive-control-legislation-in-the">coercive control</a> is becoming illegal in more countries and states/provinces worldwide.</b>
- <i>If you're a victim needing help against cyberabuse especially in <a href="https://safeescape.org">online domestic abuse</a> and <a href="https://metta-space.com">hostile environments</a>, please contact us.</i><br>

<b>Do No Harm:</b> <br>
All collaborators, researchers, and observers are required to sign, acknowledge, agree to "Do No Harm" agreements. If you are one of the victims listed in this study and need harmful material removed or to collaborate with us, please contact us.
<br><br>We do not include the code or full data to protect individuals in this study and to prevent harmul operations. As a precedent, other reseachers and students should use this GitHub and study as a basis for their own social network analysis projects. We draw attention to this project months before in-person appearances for safety.

<b>Scientific Methods:</b><br>
Worldwide Data Scientists, Researchers in Cyber Intelligence, PhDs, and Data Analysts collected and analyzed data. We used the scientific method of testing.
<br>
- <i>Scientific Method: Observation, Question, Hypothesis, Experiment, Results, Conclusion 
 <br>- Limit Variables and Repeat Same Methods on all platforms. 
<br>- Cross-checking multiple times with full field JSONs and CSVs with processes in data science.</i>

"Category One operations only spread within one community on one platform, while Category Two operations either spread in one community across multiple platforms, or spread across multiple communities on one platform. Category Three operations spread across <i>multiple social media platforms and reach multiple communities.</i> 
 <br>Category Four operations break out from social media completely and are amplified by <i>mainstream media</i>, while Category Five operations are amplified by <i>high-profile individuals</i> such as celebrities and political candidates. 
 <i><br>An IO reaches <b>Category Six</b> if it triggers a policy response or some other form of concrete action, or if it includes <b>a call for violence.</i></b>"
