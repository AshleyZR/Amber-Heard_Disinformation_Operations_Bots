# Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots
<b><i>Social Network Analysis of Disinformation/Influence Operations and Bots</i> Cross-Platforms on <i>Amber Heard</i>. 
<br>Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, Change.org, and Facebook for <i>6 Social Media Platforms</i>.</b>

#### <i><b>Millions of Texts and Millions of Accounts were studied for Social Network Analysis.</b></i>

We're Worldwide Independent Researchers with over 20 data analysts, scientists, and observers analyzing this data for over a year. Research and development is ongoing, and this public operation spanning for years continues. We invite researchers and students to study this public case example. 

#### <i><b>Data collected on Amber Heard is primarily related to the years 2018-2021, ongoing into 2022.</b></i>

This is the most detailed public analysis of a disinformation operation and the most voluminous yet - showing the impact of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-breakout-scale-measuring-the-impact-of-influence-operations"><i>Category 6</a> influence,</b></i> globally affecting the public, businesses, nonprofits, and entities beyond the victim. This work is in-progress and prepared for peer-review.  

<b>Our Purpose is to create Precedents and Foundations to help other victims of cyberabuse, bots, domestic abuse, <a href="https://www.connecticutprotectivemoms.org/coercive-control-legislation-in-the">coercive control</a>, hostile environments, and Disinformation Operations to improve lives.</b> 
<br>We want to save lives and help partners create systems to help online - e.g., specialized and accurate rescue, quality custom studies, data analysis, Social Network Analysis, forensics, research, situation awareness, data science projects, services mitigating disinformation/influence operations, and rescue/public safety technologies - <i>with focus on the victim primarily and <b>her environment</b></i>.

### <b>Collaboration:</b> 
If you're a social enterprise, researcher, organization, student, or academic helping female victims of abuse, coercive control, domestic abuse, bots, harassment, or hostile environments - we welcome partnership with you. 
<br>Our studies and data can be used for Social Network Analysis, Data Analysis, machine learning, Natural Language Processing, artificial intelligence, Data Science labeling, anti-abuse, rescue projects, anti-crime, timelines, OSINT, simulations, and monitoring systems to help other victims and their lives. 
<br><br>Since this data is high volume about domestic abuse and gender, with an actress and film industry element, it's highly relevant for classification and data science projects on those topics.
<br><i>Please contact us for data and code.</i>
<br><br>
<b>Although it's abuse of process, <a href="https://www.connecticutprotectivemoms.org/coercive-control-legislation-in-the">coercive control</a> is becoming illegal in more countries and states/provinces worldwide.</b>
- <i>If you're a victim needing help against cyberabuse especially in <a href="https://safeescape.org">online domestic abuse</a> and <a href="https://metta-space.com">hostile environments</a>, please contact us.</i><br>

#### <b>Do No Harm:</b>
All collaborators, researchers, and observers are required to sign, acknowledge, agree to "Do No Harm" agreements. If you are one of the victims, businesses, nonprofits, or entities listed in this study and want to collaborate with us, please contact us.
<br><br>We make this study and data fully open to <a href="https://www.teamscopeapp.com/blog/6-repositories-to-share-your-research-data">Public Research</a>. We do not include the full code, however, we make data open on data repositories to protect the individual in this study, to make a long-lasting impact for learning in the scientific world, and to prevent harmful operations. As a precedent, other researchers and students should use this GitHub and study as a basis for their own social network analysis projects. We draw attention to this project months before in-person appearances for safety.

### <b>Scientific Methods:</b>
Worldwide Data Scientists, Researchers in Cyber Intelligence, PhDs, Data Analysts, and a former Google Research Intern collected and analyzed data. We use the scientific method of testing.
<br>
- <i>Scientific Method: Observation, Question, Hypothesis, Experiment, Results, Conclusion 
 <br>- Limit Variables and Repeat Same Methods on all platforms. 
<br>- Cross-checking multiple times with full field JSONs and CSVs with processes in data science.</i>

"Category One operations only spread within one community on one platform, while Category Two operations either spread in one community across multiple platforms, or spread across multiple communities on one platform. Category Three operations spread across <i>multiple social media platforms and reach multiple communities.</i> 
 <br>Category Four operations break out from social media completely and are amplified by <i>mainstream media</i>, while Category Five operations are amplified by <i>high-profile individuals</i> such as celebrities and political candidates. 
 <i><br>An IO reaches <b>Category Six</b> if it triggers a policy response or some other form of concrete action, or if it includes <b>a call for violence.</i></b>"
