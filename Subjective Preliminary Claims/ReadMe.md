# Subjective Preliminary Claims
<b>Here are claims behind the Private Sector Disinformation/Influence Operations related to risks online correlating to in-person, the motivations, the high-volume, crimes, and the devastation towards Amber Heard. 
- To save a life - and other lives these services can ravage at far lower volume due to less resilience - see attachments, leads, and read the below to understand the modus operendi, traits, risks, origins, and signs.
 <br>These interpretations are largely unseen due to the influence operations of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-breakout-scale-measuring-the-impact-of-influence-operations/">Category 6</a> - also going to in-person where both sides are influenced against her. </b> <i>Connect to Folder <a href="https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/-%20Study%20Case%20-%20Effects%2C%20Risks%2C%20Origins">"Study Case - Effects, Risks, Origins."</a> </i>
<br><i>- The bigger the challenge, the greater the opportunity -</i> <i>Be an ethical "person that takes time out to check on others, no matter who they are"</i>

By researching and providing community aid when there's an operation or abuse of coercive control in-progress, you could save a life. Here are the layers underneath where an operation comes from, how it harms others and stems from decades building up.
- When reporters fail to investigate for the victim (as in this high-profile operation) and insider threats ruin investigations, it can then fail to escalate operations to in-person to be validated,</a> here's the 'coercive control' of why...
- <i><b>Usually operations are not this long, volumnious, or deadly without ever being mitigated or acknowledged.</b></i> However, we can see the obsession to destroy victims to force them to recant through coevice control and <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/investigator-barresi-opens-up-on-hollywood/">fixers</a>.
- This goes beyond the data to look for origins of in-person violence to the online operations - including the motive to kill her with them.
<br><i>- Often finding the sources and origins is looking for where the suspicious activities and parties 'slip up' in their predictability. A main issue is lacking experts to collect obvious and public data without extortion.</i>

## Private Sector: 
Multiple private companies and services in layers are clearly being used against Amber Heard to this extreme of volume.
<br>The motivations behind these operations often come from the coercive control to take down these women, their witnesses, and their support for decades, only now moved mostly online to avoid data analysis and oversight. The higher skill, natural language, and volume stems from the amounts of funds, specialties, and layers of companies used.
- E.g., attacking the partners of these figures has been happening for decades, e.g, with <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/investigator-barresi-opens-up-on-hollywood/">'Fixers,</a>' but not publicly researched before. It truly requires gamifying and deflecting with your own data, analysis, intelligence, and power. It can ruin, destroy, and destruct.
- At higher income levels, private security can be used against women in domestic abuse. At any level, software and accounts can be used against women.
- For the first time, we're confronting these issues harming these types of women/targets and establishing precedents of technologies which can be used. We can save lives by causing chain reactions of finally caring about these situations to prevent harms earlier.

## Evolving Subjective Interpretations - 
- <b>Connect the <b>Data Science/Social Network Analysis</b> with verifiable accounts, postings and analysis with <b>cybersecurity</b> (wayback machine, domain checking, etc), and cyber intelligence research. Have multiple experts cross-check.
- Social Cyber Security interconnects with the online and in-person worlds of escalations and origins.
- Social connects with the Technology and Data.</b>

### <b>Background Interpretations of Sources:</b> <br>
It is clear that multiple layers of companies and services are used against Amber Heard. The modus operendi is clearly presented to us as ethical independent parties.

The main articles we based our studies on were on <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2019-0930.pdf">"Disinformation in the Private Sector: The Price of Influence"</a> and <a href="https://gadgets360.com/social-networking/news/devumi-a-firm-that-sells-fake-twitter-followers-to-be-probed-by-new-york-attorney-general-1805985">Devumi</a> bots - where public figures had millions of false followers and made copies of other people's biographies and personas. 

As seen in other case examples e.g., against actresses, models, socialites, and partners of atheletes, the Natural Language of these operations are similar as are their capabilities of paying hundreds of thousands to millions for these operations against women in these conditions.
<br>- Secondly, it's extreme monitoring with coercive control and domestic abuse by partners to not allow these women to move onto others. Private services and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/LegalCenter/story?id=1625097&page=1">'fixers'</a> specialize in harming women who are partners of these figures. It's abuse of process and intimidation to threaten with death, destruction.

In Amber Heard's counterclaim in August 2020, she points out how her ex-partner joined Instagram and accumulated followers in only 15 minutes which was during his influence operations against her online. At the same time, Adam Waldman, one of his workers, himself points out <b>"the fastest to 1 million followers in the history of Instagram"</b> in an email to Twitter staff after his suspension. Speed correlates to signaling for bots to be released.

<b>Private Sector - Connections to Sports accounts, Hollywood-Fixers, Bots, and <a href="https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/anthony-pellicano-wiretap-appeals-court-sentencing-1201578024/">Companies</a></b>:
- Sports accounts were not only seen by the cyber intelligence reseacher in April 2021 (Arsenal sports network), but also show in like-bots analysis.  
- Aside from the "Movie DC Monsters" Network shown on a peak day, entertainment and Hollywood-related liking-bots - with no statuses and only 'likes' - show in Twitter likes-analysis too. Clustering is a method to find similar topics, banners, and profile images.
- Though <a href="https://aiplexorm.com/online-reputation-management">AiPlex</a> took down videos of Amber Heard in Never Back Down suddenly after recent court news about her being raped, and Paul Barresi when sensing media contacts went to the <a href="https://thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/johnny-depp-should-walk-away-a-conversation-with-hollywood-fixer-paul-barresi/">only media outlet</a> writing to support Amber Heard against online bots, similar companies can be used. For example, <a href="https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/harvey-weinstein-sitrick-and-company-crisis-response-1202584227/#!">Sitrick</a> was hired as a layer by an executive producer. 
- The determination early on to understand this is through being first alerted to the issues facing Amber Heard through that leaker on Twitter claiming to be a partner of an ex-staffer checking on her in March/April 2019. Very similarly to the intimidation of death of Amber Heard either before a trial, during a trial, or afterwards through this abuse of process, is the circumstances of missing Anthony Vivien Fox, which the leaker said staff are threatened about daily. Moreover, the other warnings of violence done towards her... 
<br>Years later, there's the <a href="https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/-%20Study%20Case%20-%20Effects%2C%20Risks%2C%20Origins/Osint_Data%20Suspicious%20Origin%20Accounts/AmberHeardRUOk">"AmberHeardRUOK"</a> account which says, "Average person that takes time out to check on others, no matter who they are" created November 2021.

Along with the case's circumstances of intimidation, violence, missing people, high wealth of opposition, Hollywood fixers, and suspicious activities, the online world similarly has been made threatening to exploit the <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/">Data Void</a>.
<br><i>"Data voids are not unique to search engines; they occur on social media platforms, too."</i>


Moreover, to attack anything related to her can be authorized through not only through jealousy to have her never be with other men, but the plan to destroy her humanitarian work - as if anything positive about her is related to her ex-partner - as warned through the ex-partner staff leaker (shown in files here), can be similar to companies and services hired to destroy rivals. 

<b>Many Other Victims Seen from Understanding this Case</b> - E.g., Services like USA Forensics are used against other women in the fashion/music industries in Los Angeles. There are other services that other partners use which actors used. Imagine the audio editing leak in Feb 2020 - correlating with use of bots to amplify the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg/videos">edited/split audio</a> and a created channel - affecting many other women. We point to decades of skills. Where are the services helping these women? Where is the understanding to the digital world?

### Hiding Cyber Crime in Private Sector:
Similar to the investigations of money-laundering - seen by <a href="https://iosi.global">IOSI</a> of parties related to her ex-partner - cyber criminal activities can similarly 'clean' in layers. For example, layers can be used to trivialize, to hide the cyber crime activities. E.g., the use of "Peter Pan" or "Monty Python." These accounts point this out within their chats, and Bot Sentinel also saw "Peter Pan" as well as a political name signing. This correlates with the accuracy known by the additional skilled influence layers. However, there are other companies including for social media community building as seen with the obvious bots and takedowns on YouTube.
 
- Many accounts, retweets, and amplifications surround threatening Amber Heard with state-actions, which correlates to the distraction of having Adam Waldman hired by John C. Depp II. It is true that these operations are far more volumnious than e.g., against Rose McGowan (thousands of bots), Ashley Morgan Smithline, Brittany Murphy, or Meghan Markle (<i>See folder <a href="https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/-%20Study%20Case%20-%20Effects%2C%20Risks%2C%20Origins/OSINT%20Private%20Sector%20Operation-Origins"> - Other Case Examples</i></a>). There are also examples of using other softwares and <a href="https://youtu.be/nojknljfvME">tampering strategies</a> from Hollywood fixers, e.g, against Nicole Kidman during her separation. 
- Using 'Timeline Comparisons - Events,' it can be seen that the operations online do not correlate correctly to events, that the data continues despite in-person activities, with the exception that threat analysis clearly shows correlation. There is abuse of process with the courtcases and some leaks.
Try to correlate the intensity of the data and traits to how it changes in-person to be more restrictive, isolated, and difficult.
 - Schillings Partners with largely <a href="https://www.schillingspartners.com/services/digital-communications/#capabilities">digital services</a> is mostly a 'cleaning' or legitimizing layer hiding the threatening, life-destroying bots we see in data science.
- Interestingly, activity shows on Decemer 28, 2021 on Anthony Fox's page at <a href="https://charleyproject.org/case/anthony-vivien-fox">the Charley Project</a>. During these suspicious, high volume, and covered up operations against Amber Heard, Fixer Barresi claimed to open an investigation on Fox. Fox had run to Santa Clara in the Bay Area - a 6 hour drive from Los Angeles - before his trial.
<br><i>Witnesses for her, e.g., Melanie Inglessis, have been <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/amber-heards-makeup-artist-fighting-live-testimony-johnny-depps-uk-libel-trial-1296661/">afraid of providing video links</a> of tesifying <a href="https://wixlabs-pdf-dev.appspot.com/assets/pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=%2Fpdfproxy%3Finstance%3Dh90FqYxRowo4LOaN6Gy0svFCBIny1NuRQ6vJ0SL0eZ0.eyJpbnN0YW5jZUlkIjoiMzQxZWY5OGUtZTBjZS00YzUwLWI4N2ItNGExODJiYjBiYzhkIiwiYXBwRGVmSWQiOiIxM2VlMTBhMy1lY2I5LTdlZmYtNDI5OC1kMmY5ZjM0YWNmMGQiLCJtZXRhU2l0ZUlkIjoiODBiMDgxNzEtY2U3My00NDg4LWIzNjktZmUzOTM0YjA1MDRhIiwic2lnbkRhdGUiOiIyMDIwLTA3LTIzVDAxOjUzOjE3LjA5NloiLCJkZW1vTW9kZSI6ZmFsc2UsImFpZCI6ImM5MjVkZTc3LTQ4ZjYtNDI2My04NDAyLWIyNTVlOWVlZjU5ZiIsImJpVG9rZW4iOiJiNGFlNzhmZi0yZWJkLTA4ZDgtMGIxMi1iNDIxMWYwMGVjYzciLCJzaXRlT3duZXJJZCI6IjVkZjUwNTBkLTQ1ZWQtNGFlZS1hMTU5LWIxODY5ZGZiMjk0YyJ9%26compId%3Dcomp-kcxs7142%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdocs.wixstatic.com%2Fugd%2F5df505_d1f4c2c65ff84b80b2a7cd173589abd9.pdf#page=1&links=true&originalFileName=Melanie%20Inglessis%20declaration&locale=en&allowDownload=true&allowPrinting=true">beyond depositions</a> due to the online operations - previously lowered to 'harassment' before data analysis and inquiries.</i>

In Data Science, Social Network Analysis, and Technology/Social Media Companies in general, there is a high burden of evidence. They wanted verifiable data and analysis of high volume, which we obtained. However, there are also the issues of responsibility and the lack of advocacy for Amber Heard's wellbeing online. When we're trying to analyze with an in-progress influence operation at the same time, it can be highly stressful and challenging.

### Weaponization of Disinformation/Influence Operations:
Similar to Kate Starbird's video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=498-c_SjArg">"Emerging Technology Speaker Series - Beyond Bots and Trolls - Understanding Disinformation"</a> at Mozzila, the two sides of a issue are manipulated against the victims in influence operations. 
<br>Commonly the operations against Amber Heard will take on personas of groups that should have actually supported her. It weaponizes these personas against her. E.g., "Hunting Hound's" biography of claiming LGBTQ. Notice that insider threats may claim to be be politically on the left, yet euthanize Amber by stopping the abuse from being stopped through not letting her leave the 'fixers' or obtain expertise. The political name signing was on the right. 
<br>- Interestingly, an insider threat recommended Ronan Farrow early on. This actually helped our studies significantly to realize about private security firms of ex-agents, what happened to Rose McGowan and other actresses <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies">with evidential reporting</a>, but we never talked to him and multiple leads to that person to have technological analysis or investigations was taken, read, and ignored. 

#### Intimidation and Traits of Targeting:
Amber Heard shows distress on her Facebook page to change the photos around Waldman's actions. Everyone focuses on him, but the data analysis is required to see the layers of services. It's why when writing a preliminary <a href="https://medium.com/@aquaman-bots/how-social-bots-created-an-anti-amber-heard-aquaman-campaign-e68e16637d3a">Medium article</a> comparing the numbers acoss-platforms and basic background in Febuary 2021, a quote is twisted about Winston Churchill by Waldman to attack Amber instead of to help her. Poptopic au similarly posts about Churchill and claims to be an Australian media-focused site created in 2019. 
- Moreover, "IntelligenceUK" claims private services to get money and attacks UK Judges. The website intelligenceuk.com is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210515000000*/https://intelligenceuk.com/">bought in 2018</a>, then starts posting in 2020 and its fake site has activity in 2021 after Amber Heard is a successful witness in the NGN UK Case where 12/14 incidents proven mainly through documentation. This matches Recorded Future's study of creating false sites, including to intimidate.

- It was imperative to look to sources that weren't helping her at the time - related to cybersecurity, AI/ML, social network analysis, DARPA can further study operations cross-platforms, notifying organizations that are working to make the digital world safer. The operations were/are trending and posting constantly to persecute Amber. Moreover, we have great Australia contacts. If you look at other actresses, they were made to believe the government was against them and all of these sources couldn't be used.

- Operations, including psy-ops, are dangerous. The use of accounts and timings to invoke fear, hopelessness, and isolation are dangerous - see file "online social effects."
<br> It's imperative the victim doesn't look at the operations, requiring 3rd parties. Think of frequency, target, source.


#### <b>Perspectives and Destroying a Life</b><br>
On top of the operations trying to end her life by sending her into a warp spiral through perspectives, the files here show gender violence which itself is painful to relive over and over. Anything she appears to have represented, or supported, has been destroyed and held against her. 
<br>E.g., when she was an ambassador for Cyber Civil Rights - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2021*/https://www.cybercivilrights.org/welcome/amber-heard-ccri-ambassador">page now removed</a> - she stated it was painful to have her images manipulated and exploited, yet everyday, she has to relive that through these operations. 
<br>We could see early there are bots on Twitter using botscores such as a petshop and Reddit sexualized accounts like 90police posting in seconds. However, imagine this instead further to threatening a life, attacking with mentions any social connection or business to her, and twisting continually. We move further...

<b>It's important to see that this influence is due to her ex-partner targetting her and it's not because of her coming forward. The volume, analysis, skill, and our data is enough to show this.</b>

The <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/private-mossad-for-hire">Psy-Group</a> like operation focuses on usernames for 'likes/upvotes' which are related to her Natural Language/NLP. E.g., Reddit's 3rdPrizeIsYourFired, TruthBeThePrejudice, the-speed-of-pain, correlates to sudden 'likes' on Twitter like to b--respector, badcrippie, among others. The language on multiple platforms is similar. 
<br>However, groups like a Psy-Group go further to manipulate what people perceive.

### <b>A Psy-Group-like explanation, insider threats, and vulnerabilities</b><br>
The article on <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/private-mossad-for-hire">Psy-Group</a> mentions understanding the vulnerabilities and exploitations of the social media companies. Perspectives has to do with emotions, angles, colors, verocity, amounts, timings, symbolism, etc. 
- It's interesting that in 2019 when hired to content review, a male comedian and JD were case examples for using the Bing API to remove accounts if fake, and it was in an interview about studying the cyber abuse, yet the abuse against AH was not removed. The companies have differing cultures themselves - e.g., ex-Google and ex-Twitter interns or workers can be more helpful to us while Facebook was more challenging, not removing anything unlike Reddit, Twitter, YouTube/Giphy. Never the less, cybersecurity would have responded. Since Nov 2019, it's been suspicious of infiltration.
- Early on apparently, a 'hacker' with a computer in a DC museum uses JD's face as a profile photo, too, and kept communicating with BotSentinel. 
- When McGowan's credit history was removed, it was stated it could likely be an insider in FinTech. It also felt like chats could be synced to cause fear of commmunications with her. 
- Hollywood Fixer Anthony Pellicano's - related to a predictable Paul Barresi who is attacking Amber Heard by exploiting generational ignorance - history mentions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Pellicano#cite_note-Resentence-20">software</a> early on.

<b>Threat analysis</b> and our studies shows the timelines to escalations of risks with keywords, phrases use. Hundreds of thousands of threatening texts exist against Amber Heard on the 6 platforms. In examples, within tens of thousands of repeated same texts on YouTube, false interactions on all platforms, and cryptic bot networks are people brought into them to threaten Amber Heard. 
<br> We show increases of threats and escalations - even in spite of her winning in cases or gaps of announcements. <i><a href="https://youtu.be/kTTqIqqqRjA?t=89">(Video Coded Bias: Voting Experiment on Social Media)</a></i>

#### <b>"High Risk" preventing stopping the Private Sector operations through political confusion:</b>
- The use of Waldman is a decoy from finding the layers of companies, services, and it's used to terrirfy Amber Heard. The organizations, nonprofits she was with don't know how to combat operations. 
- <b>To ruin a person like Amber Heard who had recently gained ambassador positions of organizations, United Nations Human Rights Champion position, required significant volume, time, and skill. </b>A large issue is knowlege of how to exploit and intimidate. 
- A majority of Social Network Analysis - e.g., <a href="https://www.insna.org/socnet">SOCNET</a> - is around elections or general broad issues instead of abuse and crime.
- Second, political ploys are used to scare and to intimidate, as well as to lock into a space without a solution. There are no political views to our scientists and analysts. We leave this out because it's a trap. In targeting situations, so-called 'movements' created are actually done to mask targeting individuals. Their ultimate goal is to prevent interference from helping the victims. 
- Again, remember the needs to get people to help who otherwise wouldn't be notified. The issues around Amber Heard were flagged with 'High Risk' twice in preliminary inquiries - in fact disbanding the first research group. For example, Adam Waldman was actually <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-02-26%20CEG%20to%20Waldman%20%28Mr.%20Steele,%20Mr.%20Deripaska,%20and%20Mr.%20Jones%29.pdf">a registered</a> foreign-agent which draws attention. Similarly, McGowan and Brittany Murphy with Monjack were threatened by state-intimidation after whistleblowing.
<br><i>However, in August 2021 at the early stages there were risks explained by Project Vigilant <a href="https://twitter.com/chetuber">working on the backend</a> about the Select Committte and Adam Waldman was flagged by them. Months after we see strange activities that possiby pointed to backend federal investigations. The previous year, it's possible about a lawyer of Dan Scavino's ex wife and L'Oreal meeting a team member in New York. Regardless, this is a Private Sector issue. Overall, it was a very unsafe channel, which we pushed away for protections, but worth the risk to find evidence.</i>

### <b>Technology/AI is Easier on Public Figures</b>

Bots can be used without APIs, but with layers of companies and services, it's likely both, similar to Devumi e.g. Since Amber Heard is a public figure, it's <a href="https://semiosis.github.io/apostrophe/">shown by a top Artificial Intelligence Researcher</a> that it's easier to create language on her than less-known people. What's webscraped online for the language models is stored. This would make it easier along with the decades of history already to attack her with skill and precision. There is a higher volume, and essentially, personas of figures can be chosen for the botchats. E.g., through Davinci codex, GPT-3, etc. 
- A Cambridge Analytica reporter was tipped early on, but from the perspective of the tech industry after 6 years of learning especially from this project, the social media companies actually should be very eager to stop this cyber crime and remove it from their systems if properly channeled. Notice - Cambridge emphasized APIs which aren't required.

<b>As technology researchers interested in ethics and social effects of tech, we do want this to be an example for positive change instead of destruction. It needs to be investigated and mitigated.</b>


## <b>Questions:</b>
 1. What other case studies can you think of similar to this one?
<br>2. How can the different layers be analyzed, and unarguably presented? Can you correlate the data, timings of the NLP to multiple types of evidence?
<br>3. How can the Data Science, Cybersecurity, Private and Public interests remove gaps in stopping these types of operations?
<br>4. How does the online data and motivations correlate to threats and predictable actions in previous instances from the related individuals?
<br>5. How can we prevent similar operations to save lives and stop the distress of the victim by mitigating the harms?

- We're creating precedents to have this public research study... Have data and quantifications evidence, then reverse engineer why/origins, and collect suspicious activities throughout for ethical experts.
