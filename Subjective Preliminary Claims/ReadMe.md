# Subjective Preliminary Claims
Shows the risks correlating to in-person, the motivations, and the claims behind the private sector disinformation/influence operations.
<br>The bigger the challenge, the greater the opportunity.

## Evolving Subjective Interpretations - 
<b>Connect the <b>Data Science/Social Network Analysis</b> with verifiable accounts, postings and analysis with <b>cybersecurity</b> (wayback machine, domain checking, etc), and cyber intelligence research.
<br>Social Cyber Security interconnects with the online and in-person worlds of escalations and origins.
<br>The Social connects with the Technology/Data.</b>

Interpretation: <br>
It is clear that multiple layers of companies are used against Amber Heard. Similar to the investigations of money-laundering, cyber criminal activities can similarly 'clean' in layers.
<br>For example, layers can be used to trivialize, to hide the cyber crime activities.
<br>As seen in other case examples e.g., against actresses, models, socialites, and partners of atheletes, the Natural Language of these operations are similar as are their capabilities of paying hundreds of thousands to millions for these operations against women in these conditions.
<br>Secondly, it's extreme monitoring with coercive control and domestic abuse by partners to not allow these women to move onto others. Private services and 'fixers' specialize in harming women who are partners of these figures. It's abuse of process and intimidation to threaten with death, destruction. 
- Sports accounts were not only seen by the cyber intelligence reseacher in April 2021 (Arsenal sports network), but also show in like-bots analysis. Clustering is a method to find similar topics, banners, and profile images.
- Many accounts, retweets, and amplifications surround threatening Amber Heard with state-actions, which correlates to the distraction of having Adam Waldman hired by John C. Depp II. It is true that these operations are far more volumnious than e.g., against Rose McGowan (thousands of bots), Ashley Morgan Smithline, Brittany Murphy, or Meghan Markle (See folder - Other Case Examples). 
<br> This could correlate with the accuracy known by the additional skilled influence layers. However, there are other companies including for social media community building as seen with the obvious bots and takedowns on YouTube.
- These interpretations are largely unseen due to the influence operations of Category 6 - also going to in-person where both sides are influenced against her. 
<br>Similar to Kate Starbird's video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=498-c_SjArg">"Emerging Technology Speaker Series - Beyond Bots and Trolls - Understanding Disinformation"</a> at Mozzila, the two sides of a issue are manipulated against the victims in influence operations. 
E.g., commonly the operations against Amber Heard will take on personas of groups that should have actually supported her. It weaponizes these personas against her. E.g., "Hunting Hound's" biography of claiming LGBTQ.

- Operations, including psy-ops, are dangerous. The use of accounts and timings to invoke fear, hopelessness, and isolation are dangerous - see file "online social effects."
<br> It's imperative the victim doesn't look at the operations, requiring 3rd parties. Think of frequency, target, source.

Along with the case's circumstances of intimidation, violence, missing people, high wealth of opposition, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/LegalCenter/story?id=1625097&page=1">Hollywood fixers</a>, and suspicious activities, the online world similarly has been made threatening to exploit the <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/">Data Void</a>.
<br><i>"Data voids are not unique to search engines; they occur on social media platforms, too."</i>

## <b>Questions:</b>
<br>1. What other case studies can you think of similar to this one?
<br>2. How can the different layers be analyzed, and unarguably presented? Can you correlate the data, timings of the NLP to multiple types of evidence?
<br>3. How can the Data Science, Cybersecurity, Private and Public interests remove gaps in stopping these types of operations?
<br>4. How does the online data and motivations correlate to threats and predictable actions in previous instances from the related individuals?
<br>5. How can we prevent similar operations to save lives and stop the distress of the victim by mitigating the harms?
