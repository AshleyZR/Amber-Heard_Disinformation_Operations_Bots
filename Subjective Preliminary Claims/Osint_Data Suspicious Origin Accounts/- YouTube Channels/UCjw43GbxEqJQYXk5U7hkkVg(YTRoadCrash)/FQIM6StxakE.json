Cisco Packet Tracer rip routing.\n\nThe Routing Information Protocol, or RIP, as it is more commonly called, is one of the most enduring of all routing protocols. RIP has four basic components: routing update process, RIP routing metrics, routing stability, and routing timers. Devices that support RIP send routing-update messages at regular intervals and when the network topology changes. These RIP packets include information about the networks that the devices can reach, as well as the number of routers or gateways that a packet must travel through to reach the destination address.
