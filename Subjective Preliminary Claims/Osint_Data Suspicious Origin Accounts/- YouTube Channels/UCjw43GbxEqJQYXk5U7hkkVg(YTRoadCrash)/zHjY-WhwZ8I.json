A block cipher is a cipher in which groups of letters are enciphered together in equal length blocks. The Hill cipher was developed by Lester Hill and introduced in an article published in 1929.\n\nEncipher\nIn order to encrypt a message using the Hill cipher, the sender and receiver must first agree upon a key matrix A of size n x n. A must be invertible mod 26. The plaintext will then be enciphered in blocks of size n. In the following example A is a 2 x 2 matrix and the message will be enciphered in blocks of 2 characters.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher",
