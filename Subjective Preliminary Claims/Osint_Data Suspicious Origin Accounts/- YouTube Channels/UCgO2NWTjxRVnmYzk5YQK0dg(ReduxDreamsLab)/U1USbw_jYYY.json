If you're a returning player on ps3 and xbox 360, you'll also be able to find these exotic vehicles.\n\nThis is what i found so far\n\nSuperCars:\n\u25ab\ufe0fGrotti Turismo R\n\u25ab\ufe0fPegassi Zentorno\n\nSports Cars(Customized):\n\u25ab\ufe0fPegassi Infernus\n\u25ab\ufe0fDinka Jester\n\u25ab\ufe0fBenefactor\u00a0Surano\n\u25ab\ufe0fBravado Gauntlet\n\u25ab\ufe0fCoil Voltic\n\n\u25baLeaving a LIKE would always appreciate! \n\u25baSubscribe for latest video uploads! http://bit.ly/29ZRld9\n\nOur social media:\n\u25fdLike on Facebook: http://bit.ly/2acp9pO\n\u25fdFollow on Twitter: http://bit.ly/6zco6Xb\n\u25fdMessage on Hangouts: Redux Dreams Lab\n\nNotice:\n\u25fdIf you find nothing at the parking slot, don't switch the characters yet.
