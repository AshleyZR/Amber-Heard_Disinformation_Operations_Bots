<b>Wordclouds and lists for Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram on Amber Heard Social Media Data<b>
<br>Heat Maps for YouTube and Instagram

<b>Clustering Analysis</b> is especially required for Twitter in order to show bots, since Twitter likely is requiring AI and more sophistication by the services to avoid how it's the most studied platform.
<br>2nd, it's especially required due to the cross-platform breakouts of the influence operation. Since Change.org does not readily provide an API unless reverse engineering it like we did with an ex-google intern who helped us since their friend was a victim of NLU bots too and in tech ethics,
<br>the cross-platform use of Twitter (most used of all platforms for sharing URLS - as shown in comparative White Helmets study too) is required to demonstrate bots used on Change.org. Although milestones can be obtained on Change.org, without the timings of every signature, it can be difficult based on comments and milestones alone unless you do cross-platform peaks.

<b>Bots seen with nonsensical mentions around petition</b>: e.g., there are numerous nonsensical letters and numbers of account mentions around the Aquaman petition within the April 2022 803 clusters (so many clusters/tweets than ever before on Amber Heard, that it required a different computer with more RAM).
<br>Even in 2020 in the top peaks, nonsensical mentions were seen by the Italian cyber intelligence researcher. This means that for at least 2 years, the companies doing this to Amber Heard have not bothered to change their modus operendi.
<br>In fact, the volume has only increased. The increasing clusterings of nonsensical mentions match the peaks of milestones (millions of new 'signatues) onto change.org against Amber Heard to flood against her name.
<br>For Change.org, although the company closed the comments for abuse - our researcher collected comments which were still being made. This means that these companies prefer to login to do the signing. Most people would not take the time to login before signing a petition. Among this, we can compared deleted NLU Twitter accounts (out of the over 9,000) with the signatures on Change.org from these logged-in comments.

Wordclouds are quick ways to understand and visualize what's happening on social media against the target, Amber Heard, including it's hyper-focus.
<br>Comparitively, we can see nonsensical mentions do not occur outside of the keywords clustering against Aquaman and removing Amber Heard from Aquaman - DC Entertainment.
