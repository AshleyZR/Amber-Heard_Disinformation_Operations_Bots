<b>Clustering Network Analysis and Data Groups by Italian Cyber Intelligence Researcher for 2018-April 2022 on Amber Heard</b>

Each month has its own folders with data and visualization (viz) files. The Viz files contain the clustering with hundreds of wordclouds and groups of accounts.

In many of these files, you can see nonsensical mentions (random letters and numbers) of other accounts, which demonstrates services/a company using bots to astroturf on Twitter.
This needs additional analysis.

Twitter is especially used for sharing URLS (e.g., the petition against Amber Heard). Wordclouds frequently show attacking Amber Heard about Aquaman and the petitions. Share counts are done on Change.org and log-in accounts to astroturf share counts and views.
<br>The study on the rescue group White Helmets in academia demonstrates that one of Twitter's main purposes is to share urls.
<br>Further, we can see NLP from Reddit threatening images sometimes repeating here in wordclouds. A research paper shows that Reddit is frequently used as a sandbox, however, there is lower volume of bots as it's hard to use IP4 vs IP6 on it(costs more). 2ndly, Instagram cannot flood against her name like other platforms because Instagram has high restrictions with detecting bots quickly, so attacking her would be more obvious.
From data science, these groups were astroturfed. With the data and analysis, it is clear it's an operation, not a campaign or groups. Sadly, each platform is used for its own purposes. 

From a previous analysis guide, it's explained that the Google Sentence Encoder is used for cluster analysis. Code is provided for further public research.
