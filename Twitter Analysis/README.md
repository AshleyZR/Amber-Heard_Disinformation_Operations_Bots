# SNA-AH-Case - Twitter 
<i><b>Twitter - Social Network Analysis on Amber Heard's Case Example from Data Analysts, Researchers, and Scientists.</b></i>

<b>To get a fuller understanding of the scale of the <a href="https://twitter.com/benimmo/status/1309532354306879488">Category 6</a> operation and of quantifications of the risks, we started with Twitter then moved forward to 7 platforms. We have Amber Heard data from 2008-2022. Since Twitter operations use more dense Artificial Intelligence prompts, <a href="https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/Twitter%20Analysis/2018-2022%20Cluster%20Twitter%20Analysis">Clustering Analysis</a> algorithms are truly required. </b>
- <b>Clustering Analysis, Analysis, reports, and data of timelines, coordination, accounts, peaks, wordclouds, hashtags, top shared urls, are included. </b>
<br><i><b>-> New accounts created each month and day correlate to peaks on Twitter.</b></i>
<br><i>It's important to study multiple platforms for situation awareness and gamification. </i>

Twitter is the most studied platform in the scientific world, which makes companies which manipulate Twitter use more advanced technologies. After a cyber intelligence researcher collected data with APIs, obtaining analysis on it was relatively fast with previous models already created and high levels of anomalies. However, clustering analysis was required to truly understand the botnets due to the AI use on Twitter of <a href="https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/Positive%20-%20NLG%20Compliments">prompts</a> compared to YouTube or Instagram.

2ndly, we had use of the Academic API, to obtain all data on Amber Heard in the archive until 2006, quote retweets, and retweets. Like-Account analysis was slow and difficult, yet, we still see about 1,200+ accounts that are for liking-only within 10K tweets from 2021.
- Clustering Analysis is needed to show use of the platform for bots used on petitions due to nonsensical mentions around Amber Heard, Aquaman, and DC Entertainment.
- Understanding AI NLU, monitoring, and NLG with prompts is useful to understand the increased density 2019 onward and data samples. 
<br>There are over 9,000 deleted or banned accounts in our <a href="https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/NLU%20Labeling%2C%20Monitoring%20Cross-Platforms">NLU Analysis</a>. From browsing other Private Sector/Hollywood Fixer operations, e.g., the modus operendi of deleting accounts after they've targeted victims and the victim's supporters may be common, which requires then monitoring and/or more future cooperation with social media companies.
- Although YouTube, one of the least studied platforms, has higher volume of accounts and Tens of Thousands of repeated same texts, and Reddit has 5,025 banned accounts as the most contributing accounts, the operation on Twitter is continual, risk-infused, and dense. There are Tens of Thousands of New Accounts Per Year.
- <i>Data Collected of Twitter: 1,732,916 Tweets and 459,228 Accounts Jan 2018-April 2022.
985,400 Tweets and 275,567 Accounts Jan 2018-April 2021. 497K Tweets with 182K accounts Jan-April 2022, (2) Over 880,000 Tweets of Top Users, (3) 700K+ Retweets, Links, (4) 56K Liking Accounts 2021, (5) 104K Quote Retweets, 57K Accounts of AH Timeline 2017-2022, (6) 134K Comments on Amber Heard Profile 2017-2022, (7) 2008-2017 with 698K Tweets on Amber Heard, Cluster Analysis 2008-2022</i>

### <b>Reports on Twitter:</b>
A Cyber Intelligence Researcher in Italy collected Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram Data on Amber Heard and created Twitter and Reddit Dashboards of statistics. Below analysis was preliminary and the start of our Social Network Analysis project. The Clustering Analysis of this researcher and collections is key.

A team of 3 Udacity graduates in nanoscience/data analysis quickly studied the years 2018-2021 for peaks, anomalies, and new account layers. NLP analysis is included, though mainly studying timelines and correlations. They created 4 years of reports and a scores report. They used machine learning and botometer to create botscores.

A 2nd team did Coordination Analysis of Top 500 accounts, including Network Graphs of following coordination. E.g., DeppSoldier_22 is an automated account with the highest posting and highest following coordination. Their reports are included and most of their data for review. With public safety grants, <a href="https://zaytrics.com/portfolio/">Zaytrics</a> had previously studied identifying risk groups on Twitter: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751157720306386

### Topic-based account groups - Cyber Intelligence Researcher Analysis - April 2021 (The start of our research):

Using Googleâ€™s <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/1">Universal Sentence Encoder</a> which encodes text into high dimensional vectors, a cyber intelligence researcher analyzed topics shared by accounts each month during 2020. To do that, they used <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameters.html">UMAP</a> for non-linear dimension reduction, then they clustered similar tweets through <a href="https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_hdbscan.html">HDBCAN</a>.
Next, they generated a network of co-occurrences for the accounts that appeared in the same clusters. They applied a community detection algorithm to the resulting network, in this case <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41695-z">Leiden</a> to find clusters of accounts that shared tweets on the same topic.
<br><i>They looked at 2 Peak Days in February 2020 and November 2020 on Twitter.</i> 
<br>We see sports bots, nonsensical mentions, and DC Movie networks in bot networks.

- Arsenal network (February)<br>
Most of the groups of accounts have expressed their desire not to see Amber in the upcoming Aquaman sequel. 
Users belonging to one of these groups, however, show similarities, in this case about 30 users have a picture of the Arsenal team as their banner image.
- Movies network (February)<br>
This group stands out from the others because instead of focusing on the events, they just tweeted to offend Amber. 
What's suspicious is that all 35 or so accounts have a picture from a movie as their banner image, mostly from DC.
- Mentions network (November)<br>
This group of 60 accounts in addition to the most used keywords and hashtags, shared words that didn't seem to make sense. 
These are probably mentions to accounts, which anyway have very unusual screen_names: tsAHuahu6E, t4m4UWQ0S5 etc..
- Mentions network (part 2) (November)<br>
Similar to the previous group, this group of 50 accounts also shared meaningless keywords.

### <b>Clustering Network Analysis and Data Groups by Italian Cyber Intelligence Researcher for 2018-April 2022 on Amber Heard</b>
Over the 5 years of 2018-2022, there are 3,658 clustering groups. 
<bbr>Each month has its own folders with data and visualization (viz) files. Viz files contain the clustering with hundreds-thousands of wordclouds and groups of accounts.

In these files, there are many clusters of texts which can be analyzed for further interpretation, e.g., nonsensical texts, shortened urls, timings of clusters of accounts. E.g., closely timed clusters of accounts all writing the same texts can often be botnets. The same can especially apply to YouTube, which won't be using as much AI prompts as Twitter is, so it can be obvious there unlike Twitter. 
<br>From this, it can be demonstrated that services/a company using bots to target Amber Heard on Twitter to then go onto Change.org petitions. 
<br>We are doing more analysis on this.

- The flood of clusters around Aquaman on Twitter shows increasing milestones on Change.org during Amber Heard's court case in April 2022. In April alone, there are 813 clusters which can show botnets within them.
- To see the wordclouds easier in images, there's this Google Folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SD1JLNFbXTjGvYJhkEFvvLKSzZZAcrfu?usp=sharing
  
Twitter is especially used for sharing URLS (e.g., the petition against Amber Heard). Wordclouds frequently show attacking Amber Heard about Aquaman and the petitions. <br>Share counts are done on Change.org and log-in accounts to astroturf share counts and views.
<br>The study on the rescue group White Helmets in academia demonstrates that one of Twitter's main purposes is to share urls/links and that's seen in this study.

### <b>Semi-Automated and Automated Accounts Layers:</b>
Accounts used on Twitter included semi-automated and automated examples in layers, e.g., the accounts can pin tweets, yet respond with AI as did "unnatural selection" and "hunting hound." An AI Auditor recognized the initial catch when studying NLU/NLP.
- However, DeppSoldier_22 is automated since it never responds and is the highest followed in coordination and highest posting top account... This layered approach is described by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/social_media_bots_infographic_set_508.pdf
- The OSINT section shows suspicious layers of fully used accounts, e.g., the devil, fake detectives/hats, etc accounts.

#### <i><b>Data analysis of Clustering, OSINT of origins, Coordination, Retweets, and Knowledge Graphs is continuing.</b></i>
