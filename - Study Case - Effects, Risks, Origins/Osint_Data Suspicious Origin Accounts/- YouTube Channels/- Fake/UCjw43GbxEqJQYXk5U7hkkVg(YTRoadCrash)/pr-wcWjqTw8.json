Complementary to decimation, which decreases sampling rate, it is a specific case of sample rate conversion in a multi-rate digital signal processing system. When upsampling is performed on a sequence of samples of a signal or other continuous function, it produces an approximation of the sequence that would have been obtained by sampling the signal at a higher rate (or density, as in the case of a photograph).\n\nFor Matlab codes check: \nhttp://onlineengineers.info/\n\nFlying High by FREDJI https://soundcloud.com/fredjimusic \nhttps://www.facebook.com/fredjimusic/\nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/RYgKd-6_Fc4\n\nUpsampling MathWorks:\nhttps://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ug/upsampling-imaging-artifacts.html",
