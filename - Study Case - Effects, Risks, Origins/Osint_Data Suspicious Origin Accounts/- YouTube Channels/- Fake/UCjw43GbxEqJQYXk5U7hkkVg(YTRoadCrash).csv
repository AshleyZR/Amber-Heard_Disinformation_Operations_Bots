The PWM Generator block implements a PWM generator. The pulse width modulation technique controls power transfer from one electrical component to another by quickly switching between full power transfer and no power transfer.

Working Principle
The PWM generator block outputs either 1 when the duty cycle is greater than the carrier counter value, or 0 otherwise. You can set the period of each cycle by specifying the timer period Tper. You can change the initial output, or phase, of the PWM output by specifying one of three types of carrier counters.

Svelte.js is a latest #framework in the market. It is a new way to build web applications.

Beside signal processing tutorials on this channel, you can find programming tutorials for  JavaScript, Svelte, React, Angular, SQL Server, .net, and c#. If you want to become a software developer and learn to code, subscribe to our channel.

It is similar to #JavaScript frameworks such as React and Vue, which share a goal of making it easy to build slick interactive user interfaces.

But there's a crucial difference: #Svelte converts your app into ideal JavaScript at build time, rather than interpreting your application code at run time. This means you don't pay the performance cost of the framework's abstractions, and you don't incur a penalty when your software first loads.

In this tutorial I will show you how to grab data from an API,
create an input box, use input box to run a search, take new search data and update our view. 
It's a basic app that gives us access to see how the Svelte handles things like: HTTP requests, Lifecycle methods, Templating - Displaying data, Templating - Looping over things, Templating - Conditionally showing things, State - Updating the data and view.

Beside signal processing tutorials on this channel, you can find programming tutorials for  JavaScript, Svelte, React, Angular, SQL Server, .net, and c#. If you want to become a software developer and learn to code, subscribe to our channel.

It is similar to #JavaScript frameworks such as React and Vue, which share a goal of making it easy to build slick interactive user interfaces.

But there's a crucial difference: #Svelte converts your app into ideal JavaScript at build time, rather than interpreting your application code at run time. This means you don't pay the performance cost of the framework's abstractions, and you don't incur a penalty when your software first loads.

In this tutorial I will show you how to grab data from an API,
create an input box, use input box to run a search, take new search data and update our view. 
It's a basic app that gives us access to see how the Svelte handles things like: HTTP requests, Lifecycle methods, Templating - Displaying data, Templating - Looping over things, Templating - Conditionally showing things, State - Updating the data and view.

We will first load our audio signal. Then we will use quantization, QPSK modulation, QPSK demodulation and dequantization.
Matlab codes: http://onlineengineers.info/
QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) is type of phase shift keying. 
A QPSK modulator can be implemented as follows. A demultiplexer (or serial to parallel converter) is used to separate odd and even bits from the generated information bits. Each of the odd bits (quadrature arm) and even bits (in-phase arm) are converted to NRZ format in a parallel manner. The signal on the in-phase arm is multiplied by cosine component and the signal on the quadrature arm is multiplied by sine component. QPSK modulated signal is obtained by adding the signal from both in-phase and quadrature arm.

In the demodulator the received signal is multiplied by a reference frequency generators (cos(ωt)) and (sin(ωt)) on separate arms (in-phase and quadrature arms). The multiplied output on each arm is integrated over one bit period using an integrator. A threshold detector makes a decision on each integrated bit based on a threshold. Finally the bits on the in-phase arm (even bits) and on the quadrature arm (odd bits) are remapped to form detected information stream.

In telecommunications and signal processing, frequency modulation (FM) is the encoding of information in a carrier wave by varying the instantaneous frequency of the wave. This contrasts with amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the carrier wave varies, while the frequency remains constant.

MATLAB is a programming language developed by MathWorks.
This engineering software is very useful for signal processing.

In signal processing, sampling is the reduction of a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal. 
In this tutorial, I will show you how a continuous-time signal can be represented in its samples and can be recovered back when sampling frequency fs is greater than or equal to twice the highest frequency 
component of the message signal.
Sampling rate or sampling frequency defines the number of samples per second taken from a continuous signal to make a discrete or digital signal.

In digital signal processing, decimation is the process of reducing the sampling rate of a signal. The term downsampling usually refers to one step of the process, but sometimes the terms are used interchangeably. Complementary to upsampling, which increases sampling rate, decimation is a specific case of sample rate conversion in a multi-rate digital signal processing system. A system component that performs decimation is called a decimator.

In the DSB-SC modulation, unlike in AM, the wave carrier is not transmitted; thus, much of the power is distributed between the sidebands, which implies an increase of the cover in DSB-SC, compared to AM, for the same power used.

The Fourier transform is one of the most useful mathematical tools for many fields of science and engineering.  The Fourier transform has applications in signal processing, physics, communications, geology, astronomy, optics, and many other fields.  This technique transforms a function or set of data from the time or sample domain to the frequency domain.  This means that the Fourier transform can display the frequency components within a time series of data.  The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) transforms discrete data from the sample domain to the frequency domain.  The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient way to do the DFT, and there are many different algorithms to accomplish the FFT.  Matlab uses the FFT to find the frequency components of a discrete signal.

In digital signal processing, upsampling can refer to the entire process of increasing the sampling rate of a signal, or it can refer to just one step of the process, the other step being interpolation. Complementary to decimation, which decreases sampling rate, it is a specific case of sample rate conversion in a multi-rate digital signal processing system. When upsampling is performed on a sequence of samples of a signal or other continuous function, it produces an approximation of the sequence that would have been obtained by sampling the signal at a higher rate (or density, as in the case of a photograph).

In this tutorial we will create a 3D plot in Matlab

surf(Z) creates a three-dimensional shaded surface from the z components in matrix Z, using x = 1:n and y = 1:m, where [m,n] = size(Z). The height, Z, is a single-valued function defined over a geometrically rectangular grid. Z specifies the color data, as well as surface height, so color is proportional to surface height. The values in Z can be numeric or datetime or duration values.

surf(Z,C) plots the height of Z, a single-valued function defined over a geometrically rectangular grid, and uses matrix C, assumed to be the same size as Z, to color the surface. See Coloring Mesh and Surface Plots for information on defining C.

surf(X,Y,Z) uses Z for the color data and surface height. X and Y are vectors or matrices defining the x and y components of a surface. If X and Y are vectors, length(X) = n and length(Y) = m, where [m,n] = size(Z). In this case, the vertices of the surface faces are (X(j), Y(i), Z(i,j)) triples. To create X and Y matrices for arbitrary domains, use the meshgrid function. The values in X, Y, or Z can be numeric or datetime or duration values.

surf(X,Y,Z,C) uses C to define color. MATLAB® performs a linear transformation on this data to obtain colors from the current colormap.

In probability theory, a log-normal (or lognormal) distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.

Y = lognpdf(X,mu,sigma) returns values at X of the lognormal pdf with distribution parameters mu and sigma. mu and sigma are the mean and standard deviation, respectively, of the associated normal distribution. X, mu, and sigma can be vectors, matrices, or multidimensional arrays that all have the same size, which is also the size of Y. A scalar input for X, mu, or sigma is expanded to a constant array with the same dimensions as the other inputs. The parameters in sigma must be positive.

The Hill cipher is an example of a block cipher. A block cipher is a cipher in which groups of letters are enciphered together in equal length blocks. The Hill cipher was developed by Lester Hill and introduced in an article published in 1929.

Encipher
In order to encrypt a message using the Hill cipher, the sender and receiver must first agree upon a key matrix A of size n x n. A must be invertible mod 26. The plaintext will then be enciphered in blocks of size n. In the following example A is a 2 x 2 matrix and the message will be enciphered in blocks of 2 characters.

The step function is one of most useful functions in MATLAB for control design. Given a system representation, the response to a step input can be immediately plotted, without need to actually solve for the time response analytically. A step input can be described as a change in the input from zero to a finite value at time t = 0. By default, the step command performs a unit step (i.e. the input goes from zero to one at time t = 0). The basic syntax for calling the step function is the following, where sys is a defined LTI object.

The step function is one of most useful functions in MATLAB for control design. Given a system representation, the response to a step input can be immediately plotted, without need to actually solve for the time response analytically. A step input can be described as a change in the input from zero to a finite value at time t = 0. By default, the step command performs a unit step (i.e. the input goes from zero to one at time t = 0). The basic syntax for calling the step function is the following, where sys is a defined LTI object.
