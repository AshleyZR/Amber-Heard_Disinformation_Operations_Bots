Published by Bandai Namco Entertainment, Elden Ring combines the best RPG elements with in depth customization and the best combat gameplay in the Soulsborne series. Elden Ring is being directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding by fantasy novelist George R. R. Martin, best known for his A Song of Ice and Fire novel series, Game of Thrones. Elden Ring takes all of the best aspects from Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, Sekiro, Demon's Souls, and takes the Soulsborne formula to a new level.\n\n#eldenring #eldenringtips #eldenringbuilds #eldenringdexbuild #eldenringbleed #eldenringbestbuild #eldenringarcane #eldenringbestbleedbuild #eldenringbestweapons #EldenRing\n#FromSoftware #invasions #eldenringbroken #Eldenringpatch\n#Eldenringupdate",
