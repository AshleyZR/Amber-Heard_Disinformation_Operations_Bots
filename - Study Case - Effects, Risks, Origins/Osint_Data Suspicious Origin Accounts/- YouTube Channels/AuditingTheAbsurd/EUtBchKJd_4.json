We will hear how he was shouted at, belittled, taken advantage of, attacked, slapped many many times, had his withdrawal medication hidden from him, was falsely accused of being the instigator of these arguments, would get black eyes and scratches along with having his finger cut off and nearly dying.\r\n\r\nWe have already heard evidence from their doctor, nurse and other medical professionals that Amber was the volatile one, the one who instigated these fights, who was never seen with any injuries what so ever. We have heard testimony from others that they also never saw injuries to Heard. \r\n\r\nLater this week we will have further testimony and video footage that will prove, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that the incident at the apartment that effectively ended their relationship, was a complete hoax, staged to frame Johnny. \r\n\r\nAmber has already been accused by many on the stand, of being calculated and to being a strategist. She was always thinking 4 moves ahead, planning the hoax from the start. The evidence will show this. \r\n\r\nIf you have never seen the film, Gone Girl, go watch it now. You will get the idea.\r\n\r\n#johnnydepp #amberheard",
