Abusers will target people with addictions and mental health issues.
One of the reasons is that outsiders will believe them less but the other reason is that people who have an addiction or a mental health issue often have a lot of guilt over it that the abuser can push on. They can tell the person they deserve it or that no one else will put up with them.

This is absolute bullshit. You have no clue what you're going on about. 

The Sun had to prove what they said was the truth. That's how it works in the UK court system when it comes to libel. That was what they did. They proved 12 out of 14 instances of wife beating. That is the explicit ruling of the judge. You can open up any news report on the results and find that info

UK libel law does not work the way you think it does. That bullshit you're spewing is how libel in the US works, the UK is different. That's why the UK is the destination of choice for plantiffs in libel lawsuits

Obviously I’m not discounting male depression or any other problems involving males but I find most of the discourse concerning male social issues usually begins with outrage and not much  else after that, all while putting down female issues under the guise of “society doesn’t care about men and women get all the attention!” And this problem is most prevalent in the anime/meme community, places where you can pickup easy upvotes for basic male woke points.

Edit: just checked out r/MensLib and it’s pretty sweet, you should check it out too!

Evidence shown in court showed that Amber Heard also ""abused"" Johnny Depp, just as much and badly.

To be fair, both should be criticized and ""punished"" equally, meaning, both should be taken off any movie they are currently working on and going through what Johnny Depp is going through now, being taken off every platform. That would be equal treatment.

I don't personally believe this as I believe everyone has a path to redemption, but it seems like ""one side"" who claims they are ""tolerant and inclusive"", doesn't. This ""side"" also hasn't put checks and balances on many things they advocate like the ""believe all women"" belief. Women and others are taking advantage of this ""side's"" ""logic"" (heavy quotation on that one) so they can gain power in the societal hierarchy.

Johnny Depp was never a media darling, so they were basically looking for a reason to hate him. Amber Heard gave them that reason. It's also because of the Metoo movement and the connections Amber has with United Nations and ACLU, they have invested too much money on her. But I think the biggest reason is Johnny's decision to sue NGN in the UK. News group newspapers include the Sun, and they belong to billionaire Rupert Murdoch who also owns Sunday Times, Telegraph, New York Post, Fox News and many many others. He's too powerful. You go against him, he'll run a smear campaign against you through his media.So you can probably imagine why Johnny Depp losing the libel case against the Sun has given the media even more ammunition, they're getting their revenge and are pushing for Johnny to be blacklisted forever, see the most recent Hollywood Reporter article about him. He tried to shut them up and it would have been pretty big if he won, but now the media are out for blood. Truth is they don't care about Amber at all, it's all about destroying Depp. They are determined. Before the verdict came out, basically everyone thought Depp would win, including most media. So before verdict you'd find tons of articles, especially from NGN, talking about how Depp is going to lose even if he wins the case, they wanted to make sure the public will see him as the loser no matter what. So even if he had actually won, media would still be team Amber probably. There's a huge determination to bring him down, and it makes all of them look like hypocrites cause there are much worse people working in Hollywood, Depp is a scapegoat. Right now I don't even know if the best PR in the world could save him from this situation.",t3_kle1hj,r/AskReddit,KeepRocking97,2020-12-28 11:03:49+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Fact: In a deposition, Depp *admitted* headbutting Amber during an argument because he was triggered by her raising her voice towards him, something he views as disrespectful.


Fact: In a deposition, Depp *admitted* kicking in a door to a bathroom where Amber had locked herself to hide from him, striking her with it in the process. Which resulted in Amber hitting him in self-defense.


Fact: In texts to his personal doctor which were read in court, Depp *admitted* that he had drunkenly sliced off his own finger. Something, he had been falsely blaming Amber for.


Fact: In texts to Paul Bettany which were read in court, Depp suggests that they should murder Amber, then fuck her corpse and burn it 


Fact: Depp is *on video* smashing a wine glass (or bottle) during a fit of anger.

Our subreddit has decided to have a moratorium on election-related/political posts until after the elections conclude. This is because we've noticed an increase of thinly-veiled bad-faith questions which only sow division, argument, and a tribal mentality. That is not what this subreddit is about. [Refer to this announcement for more info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/jjusuf/update_politicselection_moratorium_until_after/)

After the election is concluded, this rule will be lifted. Thank you, and we appreciate your understanding.

Hello, your submission have been removed because the title isn't loopish enough.  Please repost and begin your question with one of the following phrases:

* ""What's going on with""

* ""What is going on with""

* ""What's up with""

* ""What is up with""

* ""Why are people talking about""

* ""Why have people been talking about""

* ""What's the deal with""

* ""What is the deal with""

**Please see Rule 1**

Don't forget to include a URL link for more context in the body of the post, and always end your question with a question mark.

**If your title still doesn't work after using one of these phrases, be aware that you may be using the wrong type of apostrophe (known glitch with automod).  Just try reposting with ""what is"" instead of ""what's"".**

Once they actually went to court, Depp produced plenty of evidence showing that it was actually Heard who was extremely abusive and she threw several things at him, cut off part of his finger etc.

Her secretary and staff support him and say what he says is true. Security backs him up. His ex-wife and ex-girlfriend support him and say they have never known him to be abusive. Amber Heard's own PARENTS support Depp (there was a conversation where her father told Depp just to bear it because he knew his daughter was like this).

And Amber Heard was in a lesbian relationship/marriage before and she was abusive to her previous wife/partner so she has a history of being abusive.

Johnny lost his longtime role in Pirates Of The Caribbean, and Warner Brother's dropped him from Fantastic Beasts. He is trying to clear his name by suing The Sun tabloid paper in England for libel because they called him a wife beater based on Amber's accusations. He is also suing Amber for defamation in the US and claims she was actually abusive towards him.

A lot of evidence seems to suggest she's actually the abuser, and she is trying to play a victim. The evidence against Johnny seems to only be a photo of bruises on her face that she claims was from a phone he threw at her. This has been challenged by other photos, a public appearance on tv, and witnesses saying they didn't see bruises on her after the day she claimed the incident occurred. Johnny also sent a text to a friend (not Amber) that said some really nasty things about what he would do to her, but also said he never could do. 

On the other hand Johnny has produced audio recordings of them discussing incidents in which she admits to hitting him, saying she can't promise she won't get physical with him again, gaslights him for running away instead of fighting, and says no one will believe his side of the story because he's a man. She also never mentions him physically abusing her in the recording even though they are discussing past incidents with each other.

Johnny actually lost the libel case against The Sun last month, but he's appealing. The judge's ruling is publicly available and it showed bias towards Amber by ignoring the audio tapes (because they contradicted Amber's testimony as a witness under oath), and ignoring testimony from expert and impartial witnesses while giving weight to witnesses in favor of Amber's side of the story even though those witnesses weren't impartial. There's a number of videos on YouTube from lawyers reacting to the ruling.

And just as disgusting is the fact that the ""hatred of men isn't a big deal"" crowd as well as a lot of other progressives have been dead ass silent on this. You can tell where they're loyalties really lie. They are the ones that were up in arms when Heard first accused Depp and declared he was guilty but once proof of Heard's actions came to light they went silent.

This is the Duke Lacrosse saga all over again. When Mangum accused those athletes people called for blood. As soon as her story fell apart (largely due to the fact that the DNA of the accused was not on or in her and her multiple versions of the night in question were all shot down) the people calling for blood switched to blaming the DA handling the case and outright refused to call for Mangum to be held responsible or accountable. And to be sure a mob formed around this case. The coach was harassed into resigning. Two of the accused were senior who lost post graduation job opportunities. The remainder of the lacrosse was cancelled. Yet the only person who suffered any punishment was the DA when it came to light he was hiding evidence. The mob got most of what they wanted then walked away free of consequence.

We are seeing it happen in real time. Heard is a high profile example of a woman publicly saying she assaulted a man, telling him that no one will believe him because he is a man, and then not just getting away with it free of consequence but actually getting rewarded for assaulting Depp.

She has played the victim card and is being given awards and honors for being so ""brave"" and ""taking a stand against abuse"" and brands are tripping over themselves to sign her up.

People can crying about abusive men getting away with it but they at least still have to try to lie their way out of accusations.

The problem isn't that she is a model feminist, as some victimized and embittered men in our movement could say.

Rather, the grave problem here is that (1) feminists will and do defend and enable the most horrible women like her against all reason and common sense. And (2) in practice, the ""Believe Women"" style of apologetics wiped away any trace of critical thinking, removed all safeguards against bad actors, treated men's lives as acceptable collateral damage due to the quasi-religious mythology of the ""women oppressed, men dominant.""

To add insult to injury, you are not allowed to question even an evil bitch like that. Because didn't you get the news, misogyny is everywhere, women are not believed, and you are now questioning this sociopathic monster about her false accusations that nearly drove a man to suicide. Like, how dare you hate women so much?

And where is Heard now? Got tens of thousands of dollars for a speaking gig for, I kid you not, domestic violence prevention. I guess we are now officially a society that hires publicly exposed child molesters to teach sex ed in schools, at least when it comes to gender issues.

Johnny's reputation is in shambles and Hollywood has turned on him.  Meanwhile, Amber Heard is lauded by the UN as a spokesperson in the fight against domestic violence and is given lucrative oppertunites for speaking engagements on said topic.

Hello /u/ThatPXLGuy.  you do not have enough karma to post. You need more than 2500 **total karma** to post here.

No, award karma doesn't count. We don't do P2W here.

Check your karma breakdown here:  http://old.reddit.com/u/ThatPXLGuy/overview

Read this for an explanation of post vs comment karma:

https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/au5t4i/post_karma_vs_comment_karma/eh5tgck/

/r/SpecialSnowflake 

In the meantime, feel free to post your OC memes in **r/specialsnowflake** to gain entry before you reach 2500

**Please direct questions about that to the r/specialsnowflake team**

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

#Please do not message us about this, we need the minimum karma filter to prevent spam. Thank you

That is a rundown of everything that has happened, it is unbiased so you can draw your own conclusion.

Take note how he has had previous partners, police officers and medical practitioners come forward with evidence of abuse from Amber Heard. 

Depp also released counseling recording that has Amber Heard admitting to wrong doing and says to quote:

>	""I can't promise you I won't get physical again. God, I f---ing sometimes get so mad I lose it.""

There are other news articles and reports out there, I’ll also link to the raw audio that Depp released below.

I will personally explain what she tried to extort and paste the links, because you're a lazy S.O.B . 

She tried to get a Land Rover, three of his penthouses, 125k for legal fees and $50k a month payments until death. This can be found here: https://twitter.com/ifod_net/status/1025299758536110080?s=19

The donations she promised to charity which I will quote from Amber Heard: 
""As reported in the media, the amount received in the divorce was $7 million and $7 million is being donated. This is over and above any funds that I have given away in the past and will continue to give away in the future."" Link found here: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/johnny-depp-amber-heard-divorce-read-statement-full-settlement-charity-donation-a7198621.html

The Judge has now asked for receipts which Amber has tried to quash in court several times. Anyone who has donated, would be happy to hand those over, but not Amber, because she did not donate it. Request for receipts found here :https://twitter.com/LauraBockov/status/1340403775215988736?s=09

Information from the charity's website with a list of lifetime donors, which states she has not donated the money: https://twitter.com/RubiksGlass/status/1327389636184973314?s=19

The immorality for me, (morals are your own ethic code, kinda like opinions) comes not from when someone makes a joke about how a POS who deserves in my mind to be in jail for a couple months and stripped of her fame, is now giving talks about domestic violence. Even when she, three bottles, slammed doors on fingers and faces, admitted to being abusive, somehow managed to cut off the tip of a finger with a bottle. But the immorality comes when you compare that. To someone who’s genuinely trying to help people turn their life around for the better. She’s not doing that. The opposite really. She’s making his life worse.

I mean personally I believe that amber heard was the perpetrator, and she deserves everything she’s getting. From the court documents, to the released news, to all the witnesses, and her story falling apart, i don’t know how Johnny lost the court case, mind you I didn’t follow this the whole time just read some stuff here and there.

HOLY MOTHER OF POSTMODERNISM. Do you just CHOOSE to believe in what you want to believe? Do you know why we even look at “studies” in the first place?

Also, dear God. That is just an AWFUL thing to say. Yes, men are physically stronger than women usually, but abuse is not just physical. Abuse can be verbal, psychological, of all kinds.

Look, that’s just a very stupid and backwards argument. Unnecessarily violent too. I’ll just get to the point: it sounds like you’re delegitimizing verbal abuse. Listen, women might not be able to abuse men physically in the EXACT same way men can, but you need to understand that when society has spent decades telling our young boys that they can’t hit girls, any standard, decent (so, most of us) man will refrain from doing so. Thus, if a woman were to inflict physical abuse upon a man, he would not be able to reciprocate it without social scorn and severe legal consequences that are nowhere as harsh on the woman. That, and a woman who inflicts verbal abuse on a man (because surprise, men have feelings too) won’t be able to report it or be open about it socially because of a fear of ridicule. And before you blame this on “toxic masculinity” because I know you will, please understand where that hypothetical abuse is coming from in the first place. 

Verbal abuse isn’t just “mean words”. It’s threats, lies, slander, manipulation, gaslighting, and many other terrible things that can hurt everyone. Women aren’t these perfect angels who are incapable of hurting anyone, EVERYONE can abuse and be abused, it doesn’t matter who it is. Isn’t that what true equality looks like?

Psychological abuse, often called emotional abuse, is a form of abuse, characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another person to behavior that may result in psychological trauma, including anxiety, chronic depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder. It is often associated with situations of power imbalance in abusive relationships, and may include bullying, gaslighting, and abuse in the workplace. It also may be perpetrated by persons conducting torture, other violence, acute or prolonged human rights abuse, particularly without legal redress such as detention without trial, false accusations, false convictions and extreme defamation such as where perpetrated by state and media.

I’m not trying to equate them and I find that question rather disingenuous in the context we’re bringing it up in. By pointing out statistics, like what u/OkLetterhead10 did, we can talk in objective terms about a complicated issue that has a lot of misconceptions in society. Just because women are more likely to be raped that doesn’t mean men never suffer from abuse, and the results we can find dictate domestic abuse, in all its forms, happens in a proportion that feminist theory doesn’t talk about. Also, dear God, you make it sound like all men have to be worried about is “mean words”. You don’t have to hurt someone to abuse them, and I’m seriously concerned about what opinion you have about men to think of them this way.

2. Could you PLEASE stop with the accusations? You’re using some precognition of myself as a sort of violent rapist based only on the fact that I’m disagreeing with you and trying to pass it off as a legitimate argument. I’m sorry that you would think something like that, but with all due respect, maybe you should reconsider how you’re going to talk to any man if, at the first sign of a disagreement, you already call them a mysogonistic rapist and you claim you are somehow scared of them. When have I ever threatened any harm on you? 

3. In this entire conversation, when did I ever say anyone owed me anything? Outside from basic respect and decency, given how you’re choosing to talk to me right now, I have never claimed any right to anything. If you could please just stop using a strawman to antagonize me with for a little while, you would realize that.

Men can be abused, just like women, maybe not in the exact same ways, but domestic abuse has been demonstrated to not be as one-sided as you think it is. So yes, men DO need shelters. 

Also, you keep talking about abuse without taking into account the statistics given. Please, just pay attention for a little while.

   Steve here. I am a computing student, and recently I created my own YouTube game show series. In the show we pit two of our favorite celebrities against each other and a computer called Samantha decides the winner, and gives you the answer to the question once and for all, which celebrity is the hottest?!    
   I hope you will check out my latest episode, which features Margot Robbie Vs Jennifer Lawrence!    
   Please check it out, subscribe to the channel and leave a comment below to let me know who you would like to see facing off in future episodes!

Then this year Depps lawyers submitted a video from a reality show of Amber Heards sister talking about Amber hitting her, but in court her sister said that their argument was verbal and that it was dramatized for reality tv. As far as I know both Heard and Depp posted pictures of alleged injuries. There was another video of Heard discussing hitting Depp, but as far as I know there are know videos of Heard actually perpetrating, just as there is the video of Depp throwing the bottle, and thus committing physical abuse.

It's likely the truth is somewhere in the middle. Heard admitted to punching Depp, but the Judge found compelling evidence submitted by The Sun regarding ""14 separate alleged incidents of physical abuse by Depp"".

Now unless we see this evidence I don't know how wise it is to judge based on it. The evidence called out by the judge is not physical or DNA evidence but texts.

>He cited as evidence of Depp's feelings towards Heard a 2016 text, in which Depp wrote of his then-wife: ""She's begging for total global humiliation. She's gonna get it ... I have no mercy, no fear and not an ounce of emotion or what I once thought was love for this gold digging, low level, dime a dozen, mushy, pointless dangling overused flappy fish market.""

Also:

>And he deemed it was ""unlikely"" that Heard or a friend defecated on Depp's bed while he was away, an alleged incident that Depp, in his evidence to the court, said was the final straw in their relationship and the factor that prompted him to seek divorce.

>""As long as he was away, it was Ms Heard who was likely to suffer from the faeces on the bed, not him,"" the judge wrote. ""It was, therefore, a singularly ineffective means for Ms Heard or one of her friends to 'get back' at Mr Depp.""

That has some logic, but to be fair if that had been done right before he got back, then she wouldn't have had to deal with it.

What I do care about are the consequences of a negative experience.

I later saw that some of the homeless population I served bounced in and out of legal troubles. Some of them habitually react poorly and have poor judgement. So it made sense that loss of employment followed them after an intense domestic dispute in a broken home.

Had I reacted with a lapse of judgement as well for my mistreatment, I would have no reason to go on living. I also wouldn't have Depp's millions to fall back on. My ex behaved worse than Heard supposedly had, by the way. I wish that an angry poop onto my bed mattress and finger amputation was the worst of it.

If you read the judgment, the Judge calls out the inconsistencies in Depps evidence. Depp said things with certainty that were then proven wrong from his own texts and emails. 

Now a lot of people are pissed that Depp has been hurt by this case, that Depp himself pushed and brought in the evidence from the US case to be reviewed and judged. Heard is not on trial so its a one sided affair, however after reading Depp and Heards evidence per each abusive instance, it is not difficult to realize that Depp was far more abusive than Heard.

I do believe that their relationship was not good for either person, however the vitriol on Amber is completely uncalled for. Depp was the one who pushed this case and now he is feeling the repercussions from it.

The question is not 'women provoking men into bearing them' 'that is you deliberately phrasing a false position that paints women as victims and men as aggressors who ran out of patience. 

It's fairly well established that [a vast % ( apparently 50%) of domestic violence is reciprocal ](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1d6uw9/til_that_50_of_domestic_violence_is_reciprocal_53/)

[men are less likely to report domestic violence ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-psychiatrist/article/domestic-violence-is-most-commonly-reciprocal/C5432B0C6F8F61B49A4E2B60B931FA07&ved=2ahUKEwjIk_aEm9TtAhXUQxUIHZtkCJMQFjABegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw1PlTY8nyPkf58m_APOS8ek&cshid=1608180510280)

So to frame any domestic violence situation as simply women provoking men into beating them is a terribly inaccurate take on the situation. 

When it comes to reciprocal violence unless you reach self defence levels then 'what if Depp provoked Heards  agggression' is not really a valid question. Would me saying what did Heard do to provoke Depps aggression be a fair question to ask?! What level of provocation is acceptable? If he insults her does he deserve to get a slap? 

As to your last point I don't know enough about the details to say if the level of response was appropriate.

I'm guessing that's because when a male shitbag beats a woman she feels safe legally to fight back and get support.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

What’s important is this: guys, when your girlfriend/wife/whatever hits you, and I mean HITS you, then the relationship is over right then and there.

I have a friend who was shopping for Xmas decorations with his girlfriend in a department store. They were talking about getting a tree and he opined that maybe they didn’t need a real tree.

She sucker punched him in the gut. Right there in the store.

He told me about this afterward and wanted to know what he should do. She apologised profusely the instant they got home. He still cared about her. I told him that even if he tried to move past it, even if she never did it again, this would hang over their relationship. Every time they had an argument, as all couples do, he’d wonder whether she was gonna hit him and he’d tense up. She’d notice this and know what he was thinking and it would make every argument into an argument about that time she hit him. It would kill communication in the relationship and they’d slowly fall out of love with each other. And he could either waste the prime of his life on a relationship that was doomed to fail, or he could move on now and hope that at least she would learn the lesson so that her next boyfriend would go unhit.

He listened, they broke up, and now he’s engaged to the love of his life.

ZERO TOLERANCE for physical violence in a relationship. Even if you forgive them. Even if you love them. In fact, ESPECIALLY if you love them because the only way they’ll ever find the right relationship is by learning their lesson from losing you.",t3_kdznjp,r/awfuleverything,-banned-,2020-12-16 12:16:14+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

How important it is for people like that to be separated from each other for their own good.  Many relationships are toxic because of both partners (and they can mutually bring out the worst in each other).  Bad relationships are bad for all kinds of reasons in all permutations of bad, not just ""dude hits his wife because he's an asshole"" (though that's surely among the most common).

And to be fair, people who have been in those relationships are exactly the people who should speak out about them (especially celebrities who may have a cache with impressionable young people).  If seeing Amber Heard talk about this stuff is what motivates a 20-something to change her life and seek help with her own abusive partner when they would have ignored someone less Hollywood, I can sort of accept that.  Whatever gets the message through to her.

Obviously, you would want these spokespeople to have demonstrated a genuinely healthy perspective (and in any case where they were accused of being the aggressor, seen them show genuine reflection, remorse, and growth), and I've seen no evidence that Heard has done that... so sure.  Not unawful.  But also maybe not quite awful everything either...  (Goodbye karma, though, I've learned the hard way that any comment that could be interpreted as pro-Heard at all will get skewered in most internet circles.)",t3_kdznjp,r/awfuleverything,gimme_dat_good_shit,2020-12-16 10:19:31+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

Link to that video of Amber abusing her ex.
I could go deeper and give you more concrete evidence but unfortunately I don't have the time right now.

Here is the link for the audio recordings of Heard.
She was abusing Depp and saying no one will believe him because he is a man.
There's tons more vids I can find for you, but as I said before I don't have the time.
Make any argument you want but the majority of the internet is against Heard. It's obvious she's the abuser. There is no use arguing against an idiot since they think they're always right. Maybe the only reason you're supporting her is because you're an abuser too. Whichever is the case we can go around in circles all day. 
Keep defending the abuser all you want mate. We all know you're an idiot for supporting that woman.

Yes, race is relevant when women of color like Megan the Stallion get shot in the foot and then receive backlash for ""outing"" her ex.

Police report regarding Chris Brown and Rihanna:

Christopher Brown and Robyn F. (Rihanna) have been involved in a dating relationship for approx one and half years. On Sunday, February 8, 2009 at 0025 hours, Brown was driving a vehicle with Robyn F. as the front passenger on an unknown street in Los Angeles. Robin F. picked up Brown’s cellular telephone and observed a three page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with. A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit he took his right hand and shoved her head against the passenger window of the vehicle causing an approximate one inch raised circular contusion. Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F’s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.

Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, “I am going to beat the shit out of you when we get home! You wait and see!” Robyn F. picked her cellular telephone and called her personal assistant, Jennifer Rosales at [redacted]. Rosales did not answer the telephone but while her voicemail greeting was playing, Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, “I’m on my way home. Make sure the cops are there when I get there.” (This statement was made while the greeting was playing and was not captured as a message). After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown and looked at her and stated, “You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I’m really going to kill you.” Brown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown. Brown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand. Robyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.

Brown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular phone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand. Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of [redacted] and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it. Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F’s. left and right carotid arteries causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness. She reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gauge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown’s body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet causing several contusions. Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.’s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order (EPO).",t1_gfzz0xe,r/awfuleverything,RCBOSS21,2020-12-16 17:47:11+00:00,[],Positive,Positive

>both have a history of assaulting others

Are you aware of some history of assault that I am not aware of for Depp? The judge did not find a history of assault for him. The women he dated previously wrote letters to the court saying Depp is non-violent. The actually testimony of third party witnesses consistently describe Depp and trying to leave whenever Amber started to become verbal/physically abusive.

The only reason this story took off is because it’s about a celebrity who openly got away with abusing a man, which happens to be the gender most of reddit shares. That means people on reddit might care about it and relate to it more. It doesn’t make other cases less important; you’re implying that yourself.

However, I think it’s incredibly telling that when you see a story about an abuser, you instantly take the stance of “What if the roles were reversed?” I’m sure I can speak for most people here that any kind of domestic abuse is bad.

No one said anything about what happens if the roles were reversed, so you’re putting words in people’s mouths.

But evidence definitely points at her as being the abuser. She was also arrested a few years ago with her girlfriend at the time for domestic issues. She said the reason she was arrested was because the cop was homophobic and sexist.... the cop was a lesbian. Time and time again, she has been caught bending the truth or flat out lying. There is a part if me that believes Depp could also have been aggressive, but I don't think he was the aggressor. Youtube has a lot of coverage on it, popcorn planet has good coverage. 

The worst part about this is how she is hindering women who suffer (not that men dont) from domestic abuse. People who are already inclined to use victim blaming with women will use this as an example. Anyone who is passionate about victims of domestic abuse should be pissed off about this shit. Its upsetting. 

If the roles were reversed, the sun libel case would have gone differently and this shit wouldn't be happening. Abuse is abuse. The type of shit that is emotionally abusing that she has done is 2 days after Depp mother died, she told him she wanted a divorce then filmed him getting upset and slamming kitchen doors as some sort of proof he's abusive. No one who is ""fearing for her life"" would risk being beat to shit just to film it. Most victims try to get out quietly to avoid the abuser. 

They both have issues, and Depps is with substance. But homegirl literally admitted to hitting him when (tried to use semantics to downplay) and then gave him shit for LEAVING WHEN THINGS GET HEATED. Like dude literally didn't want any part of her crazy shit and she made fun of him for ""being the good guy"".

There's also evidence her entire friend group were part of the plan as one was hiding in the flat to stage a beating to draw his security team in.

Asia Argento - accuses Harvey Weinstein, he gets his due. But when she's accused, fellow MeToo supporters (mainly women) say ""we don't know the full story"" and that we need to be patient.

Avital Ronell - an NYU professor accused of harassing a male student. An investigation comes up, she's found liable of harassment and is suspended, but should've in my opinion been fired. MeToo supporters (again, mainly women) write a letter to the university and say she's being ""attacked"".

No one deserves that""

But look into the Mainstream reception of this case outside of Reddit, and people (mostly those who immediately took ambers side and tried to cancel Johnny) are trying to use this ""enabler"" claim to make out its not fair to turn it on Amber, someone who was charged with lying by using make up to fake bruising, because HE made her do it. 

Enabler as a concept *does* have merit, but not in these situations were its used to pervert justice or do mental gymnastics. Im sure Johnny has some rough days, probably angry, mean days.

I was aware of the paparazzi incident and found Depp's actions defensible. I was also aware of the alleged City of Lies crew member incident. Last I heard the case has been postponed until 2021, but from what I have seen in public testimony, Brooks sounds like he is full of shit and Depp looks like a really nice guy. (see script supervisor's statement)

I was unaware of the 1989 security guard incident and appreciate you pointing it out. In Depp's defense, the security guard David Sulina said regarding Depp's complete discharge he thought the verdict was “fair. It wasn’t a major assault.”

I agree that Depp being non-violent with some partners does not mean he was conclusively non-violent with all partners. I do see it as character evidence though.

Regarding Amber's witnesses testimony, the first-hand testimony of Depp being violent toward Amber was from Whitney Heard and Whitney Heard's testimony is directly contradicted by Whitney's friend Jennifer Howell. (See Jennifer's letter to Whitney)

I think it's reasonable to not defend either as completely innocent. However, Depp honored the divorce agreement to not talk about things while Amber went to multiple news outlets, let the public believe she was a complete victim, and has profited off her status as an abuse victim. 

Even if someone believes both parties were equally abusive to one another, how can one not be more upset with Amber because of how she has handled it and presented it to the public?

The court didn't say that Depp beat Amber Heard. The courts agreed that most of the accusations The Sun published regarding Amber Heard's accusations against him were true.

This is may be semantics, but Depp wasn't found in court to be an abuser. The courts merely said it was not libel for The Sun to accuse him of being an abuser.

Furthermore, your argument isn't really a defense for Heard either. Whether Depp hit her or not, Heard equally abused him as well. She cut off part of his finger, assaulted him, shit on his bed, verbally and emotionally abused him, etc,.

You could argue they had a mutually abusive relationship, which I would be inclined to agree with. But Heard is definitely not a blameless, battered, victim.

Then there's WB which also is against him, and it has an even greater media influence.

There are a lot of proof and testimonials that confirm Depp's innocence and Heard's negligence, but SOMEHOW they're all less trustworthy than fake proofs given by Amber Heard, like her bruises that magically disappear after one day, an interview where they talk about the trial, depp's mildly upset while Heard genuinely smiles everytime he talks about domestic violence episodes, like, depp talks about the time she cut his finger off, and she (unsuccessfully) tries to hide a smile. and it's like that for all the interview.

The sun (and the person that wrote it) didn't even appear as a witness in the case. It was her in court as a witness saying he'd abused her. That's the case to defend the sun. Her testimony.
Regardless of what she did to him, the judge believed her that he'd hit her.

Basically the whole thing seems to be that they had a fucked up relationship (and that's giving her the benefit of the doubt). It *seems* she was indeed the abuser (actual evidence for this include recordings of her hitting him and saying nobody would believe him, him needing surgery after having glass thrown at him, her shitting in his bed and other incidents) but he physically retaliated at times (haven't seen any actual proof of this even quoted but apparently happened on a few occasions).

Now back to the point. This post is here because she's now trying to represent VICTIMS of abuse. That is seriously fucked up and people have a right to be angry. That's what the post is about.
Looks like she was right when she told him that nobody would believe him.

At the end of the day, we don’t know who instigated the violence in the relationship. There’s a cropped audio clip of Amber admitting she gets angry and hits and throw things at Johnny — which is terrible and only paints her as abusive. 

There are also text messages from her to her mother describing his anger and violence years before the divorce. 

Guy has massive drug, alcohol, and anger issues. They’ve both assaulted people in the past. 

So instead of putting words in my mouth, you should consider that the evidence made public gives you no clear idea of who’s acting in self defense and who’s perpetrating the violence.

I have a confession to make: I can fly if I flap my arms like a chicken

so, will you ask me to prove it or will you just believe I can do this because I said so? because if you truly believe that we should take what people say as direct proof then me saying this should be enough proof for you to believe me.

this is why I say that people need to back off and let the RIGHT people deal with this... we are not qualified enough to make this call so we shouldn't make this call.

Men Can be domestically abused and they need to keep records and document it AND get away, separate from their abusers, JUST like females need to do. BUT, he does have signs of abusive behavior. Controlling of job income and finances. He would flip out and verbally attack her and try to tell her not to take acting jobs. He would tell her he didn't want her to hang out with any friends or co stars and would basically accuse her of sleeping with EVERYONE she works with and would go into a rage. So that is controlling of ones independence and self sufficiency. It is controlling of ones connections to others. He has documented destroying her property, and living space and clothing. So that is threatening behavior and controlling to destroy personal possessions and living spaces. He has documented verbally saying he wants to kill her and rape her dead body. He didn't want her to leave. She did. That is not some poor abused milque toast. There are a lot of guys that other guys think are ""great"" guys, but they act differently to women and act like a different person to how they act around guys. 99% of the people testifying on his behalf are PAID by Mr. Depp. They have every reason in the world to protect him and want him to make money. Those are real behavioral triads that point to an abusive behavior. And that was BEFORE she accused him publicly of being an abuser to say that as an excuse. The guy was probably COMPLETELY blacked out and has ZIP memory of doing any of those things. He probably MOST sincerely believes that he never did those things, and is not that kind of a person. Maybe some of it stems from drug and alcohol abuse, but he idolizes drug users and doesn't seem to realize it is effecting his brain and memory. Which is another thing alcoholics and drug abusers do. They don't blame themselves, they don't blame the drugs, they blame other people for not going along with it and covering it up for them. What he DOES, need to do is go and face up to his behavior and stop blaming the person who wont cover it up for him. People who go down that road, it IS just a matter of time before they hurt themselves or someone else or have serious health problems or phycological problems. It is a wake up call and he needs to hear it. Not a bunch of morons, enabling it. Unfortunately, you kids are young, and really do not have a lot of experience with life. With people, with drugs, alcohol, personality types, all sorts of things, that people are capable of. I have had to had experiences and also I have been the person, that was not in my right mind to know about it. That I was shocked at the things I could do and have no memory of. Many of them could have gotten me killed easily. I was totally disbelieving people when they told me, as I had zero memory of it. I was SURE they were lying to ME. It was only other things, like broken bones and damage to things that made me realize maybe they were not lying. And I've seen other people do the SAME thing. Some of them going to their grave still convinced, that others were lying and they did not do the things people said. AND they get paranoid too! If they feel sick from too many drugs, NO it's not that, YOU must have poisoned my beer! If you have a non toilet trained dog, no it not the dog YOU must have shit in the bed! No, it not the simple explanation. People are malignantly out to get them! That is the only thing it can be! No, of course not, he didn't hurt himself totally trashing and smashing up the place, someone else must have done it. Face it. The whole interaction between them got utterly monstrous and dysfunctional and unhealthy. She doesn't owe it to him to cover up for him. not when it reaches death threats. and he has to face up to the fact, in an altered state he did do some things he has no memory of and not ask or need for his buddies to lie and cover up for him and attack amber. He needs people around him who have a motivation to be honest to him, about his behavior. There is nobody like that around him! Work knows he goes on benders and is unreliable, Shrinks, know he treats his drug use flippantly and is in denial about it.,If he truly is the person he says he is, then start acting like it. Be it. Not a controlling, controlling controlling person who vows to ""destroy"" a person. Lost my job due to covid one relative died. A parent died, another person who is about the closest person I am to got diagnosed with cancer. AND this year has been one of the best years in my life compared to things I have been through. Seriously. I don't even know what people are complaining about. And Frankly. He can do what he wants. I like getting wasted. If everyone could or had the money to, would do it all the time. Everyone wants, to have some person to be their ""foil"" where you are always right and them wrong, but they have to be perfect in every other way as well. BUT come on! Get some brazilian chick fleeing favela crime, or even more stupid abusive drunk relatives in Russia. Someone with no job, so you can TOTALLY say they are a gold digger and their full time job is to inflate ego. NOT someone who actually HAD a job before you met them. Do what thou wilt, but don't ask for too much. There are a million million dependent females on the earth to men. (they have all the money, wa wahh) They are used to abuse as well. NORMAAAL. So why not take one of those that are that way already instead of trying to make one? There are a million beautiful girls out there. Find what you are looking for and want and expect that is already out there. There are a million. She's a nobody. Well find an actual nobody. She a gold digger. I want her to have zero ability to have a partner except for me. DONE. tons out there. I want her totally dependent on my finances. DONE, tons out there. I want everyone to love me and hate her. PLENTY AGAIN out there to pick from. You can get whatever you want. You just have to pick a person that way ALREADY and it not to be that person. That other person, you leave them alone. Wish them happiness. Ya know. sometimes I think. My personal theory is that people expect perfection. And when that is expected of people, or they project perfection upon people horrible monstrous distortions of reality happen to try to sustain it. People are not perfect. Never will be. Not meant to be. Just achieving a sort of ""okayness"" is actually a super great goal. Systems that force that, create monstrous things. Terrible things, just as much a expecting people are bad or projecting they are bad. Sometimes people think of themselves as perfect, or other people project it, so things that don't fit, must then be projected as evil. We have a perfect ""god"" so then for the bad things there must be a ""devil"". Why can't we just let people be imperfect?",t1_gg0baj3,r/awfuleverything,PaleontologistMuch77,2020-12-16 11:04:04+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

there is no perfect flawless system so the next best thing is the lesser evil which in this case, is the court and people who have no businness interfering should NOT interfere

another thing is that discussing this is all fun and games but we all know that there are people out there who will act on these things... now if you or me spread awareness by talking about this and as a result some fuckup hears about this and attacks her or Johnny and something seriously fucked up happens, we are both indirectly responsible for that.

providing justice boners to the rich: not ok

providing justice boners to the average person on the internet: perfectly acceptable

Sorry but they're both just as bad and mindlessly hurt people in the process, if you have a problem with the U.S. legal system, change it and don't use people as poster children for a bigger issue because it always ends poorly for said people guilty or not guilty.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are people, if you have a problem with the Justice system (just FYI I do have a problem with the justice system, we're on the same page on this) then address the Justice system instead of projecting it onto people, the way things are going right now the same thing will happen as always: things get blown out of proportion, both Amber AND Johnny get scorched by all this, at the end it becomes such a shitshow that everyone feels bad for everyone involved and regret their actions, people finally make the choice to back off, the issue with the justice system is never actually addressed properly because its overshadowed by this whole Amber/Johnny case, people get tired of this whole thing, nothing changes and everything goes back to the way it was before.

Don't believe me? Just look at the whole police brutality thing and the baltimore riots from a few years ago... in the 90s they have the EXACT SAME THING HAPPEN with the L.A. riots... people were rioting on the streets because an innocent african-american was killed by the police... sound familiar? things turned out exactly like I said they will for this whole Johnny situation, nothing changed and it repeated itself like 20 years later... and it will repeat itself again, and again and again... each time new people involved and destroyed.

Men of all colors find women of all colors beautiful, and said beauty makes us make really not brilliant decisions. It doesn't matter if they're white. 

Cardi B literally admitted to drugging, raping, and robbing a man, on twitter (the pinnacle of ""cancel"" culture) and had the billboard #1 song a few months later. Not like, because she grew as a person and had an uncharacteristic elegant ballad. No, she admitted to a crime on twitter than shattered charts with a song called wet ass pussy. 

I'm not going to act like I don't know that being white in this country has deep seeded roots of certain benefits and luxury (though not remotely the same as 40+ years ago) it still exists, unfortunately. But THIS particular story is so bizarre, race has NOTHING to do with it. It's an anomaly. It's some surreal humor, idiocracy level shit. ""Woman exposed for abuse vs beloved star, loses role, universally hated gets job supporting victims of abuse""

It's INSULTING and let's be honest NOBODY  with a fucking brain would go to her for help. NOBODY. That'd be like going to bill buckner to learn how to field a ground ball, or william hung for singing lessons. What it is, is her literally abusing people again, by talk g advantage of emotionally distraught victims and fleecing them out of a lot more money than they'd have spent going to an actual social worker who isn't a millionaire.

Then again, this is the country that elected an ex reality star with several failed businesses to become the president, and his only basis for legitimacy was how he'd be a businessman and help the economy.",t1_gg01ic4,r/awfuleverything,DazedAndBanned,2020-12-16 11:30:18+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

She saw support throughout, where he was vilified, and the media tore into him. After her recording of her admitting to lying or falsifying claims and being an abuser, the media for the most part was quiet. Outside of reddit, few people know that recording exists.

There is evidence she abused him, but nothing concrete he did to her physically. In fact, there is evidence he leaves her when things got physical, something she admitted to. So its unfair to say they were both equally abusive because the evidence isnt equal.

I do. How difficult would it have been to require the sun to add the word ""alleged"" like most reputable news sources do. 

Also, I took the time to read the judges actual ruling and he made several important mistakes about the facts and these mistakes were used to rule in Amber's favor. As an example, in the finger slicing incident the judged ruled that the red writing on the mirror was Depp's and therefore Depp's testimony that it wasn't and it wasn't his handwriting was unreliable. If you google for 'writing on mirror Depp' you can compare the writing in red to Depp's handwriting. They are clearly different (look at i and t). The judge was just wrong and didn't bother to even look into it (possibly due to time constraints?)

Also, the judge was not allowed to hear evidence from Whitney Heard's boss who testified that Whitney told her Amber cut Depps finger off. The judge ruled that Depp cut his own finger tip off and shattered the bone on some broken glass. This opinion was inconsistent with the fact that Depp and his friend made up a completely different story to tell the hospital about how the finger was inquired. Why would they make up a story? If they didn't need to protect Amber because Depp had actually injured it himself by accident on glass, why not tell the hospital staff that? 

Anyway, the judge goes on to rule in Amber's favor in several incidences using the argument that, ""given that I ruled in Amber's favor in these other incidences, it is more likely that these other incidences are the same"".

For example, read the first instance , paragraph 210:

>Seen in isolation, the evidence that Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard on this occasion might not be sufficient. However, taken with the evidence as a whole, I find that it did occur.

The judge made some obvious mistakes. Depp was telling the truth about the writing in red not being his. Depp always uses a lowercase i and lowercase t yet the judge did not believe Depp on this and considered his testimony unreliable.

The judge concluded the red ""CALL CARLY SIMON, SHE SAID IT BETTER BABE"" on the bottom left was written by Johnny Depp. Here is a pic:

Because one party is getting away with abuse doesn’t mean the other should be defended or absolved of wrongdoing.

That is entirely dependent on what we are discussing. If we are discussing criminal culpability, then the court is the best commentator. If we are discussing acceptable behaviour in our society or what we want acceptable behaviour to ideally be in our society, then the latter is better. Courts only interpret the law as it is, and the law is not definitive of what is ethical. In terms of standards, ""legal"" is almost always a lower standard than ""ethical"" or ""right.""

>there is no perfect flawless system so the next best thing is the lesser evil which in this case, is the court and people who have no businness interfering should NOT interfere

As mentioned, only if you're discussing guilt or conducting fact finding about who is right between Heard and Depp.

>another thing is that discussing this is all fun and games but we all know that there are people out there who will act on these things... now if you or me spread awareness by talking about this and as a result some fuckup hears about this and attacks her or Johnny and something seriously fucked up happens, we are both indirectly responsible for that.

Neither of us would be advocating for violence against either party (I hope) so any action taken by said ""fuckup"" is almost entirely on their own person. Did we provide an initial opinion? Sure. Did we suggest that anyone take action against the people? No.

>also: nobody is doubting the morality of abusing your partner, I think we're all on the same page with thinking its completely fucked up and whoever does this is a horrible person so there isn't anything new to discuss here in the first place.

This isn't the topic of conversation. The topic that is being discussed is the apparent double standard that male abusers are cancelled and charged (despite some like Chris Brown retaining fame) while female abusers (ie Heard and Cardi B) are allowed to continue programs and their careers if not downright celebrated, as in the case of Cardi. The double standard is particularly egregious and evident in this case as we saw the reaction when the accusations against Depp came out and now we saw how the reaction is entirely different with the introduction of accusations and evidence against Heard as well, much of which has been worse than what Depp was accused of doing.",t1_gg0gz77,r/awfuleverything,SlapMyCHOP,2020-12-16 08:28:38+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

When it comes to the injustice with Johnny Depp- I actually quite agree, but I want to point out that it isn’t ‘anti-Male’ sexism that’s caused this; it’s just flat sexism. It’s the idea that women lack agency, and thus in issues of abuse it must be the man as the aggressor and perpetrator. While both have enough evidence to accuse the other of abuse in court- Depp did discuss (jokingly/hypothetically) a desire to perform some rather gruesome acts of murder on her among other things; Heard was recorded admitting to violence against him among other things- the public’s perception is that Male-on-female violence is somehow of greater intent and thus of greater threat. Even in the Sun court case, I don’t remember the judge ruling *anything* about Heard’a violence towards him, but stated that Depp ‘was a wife beater’ despite the evidence against hin being no more damning than ‘it’s enough to shield the Sun from libel’.

>I think there’s evidence aside from the examples you’ve pointed out, to showcase that Johnny is violent 

You had mentioned Amber's texts, there are Amber's pictures, and the testimony of Whitney Heard. Some people (like the UK judge) also consider the fact that Depp smashes/breaks material objects as evidence of violence. 

My problem with Amber's pictures is they are not that bad to begin with and consistently contradicted by other evidence (see police officer testimony) (see late night interview) (see testimony of the people in Australia) (see modeling photos taken) (etc.). The injuries depicted are also much reduced (sometimes I cannot even see them) from the descriptions provided by Heard. My problem with Amber's sister's testimony is that it is contradicted by Jennifer Howell's statement and by Amber's video testimony. I personally think that smashing objects can be scary and freighting to some people but that it was not particularly freighting to Amber. I disagree with the UK judge that violence toward inanimate objects is indicative of violence toward people. I also feel like pretend violence in a text message should not be taken as evidence of violence in real life. 

I agree with you about many redditor's comments being disgusting with a  misogynistic edge.

I disagree with your original comment that Depp doesn't deserve to be defended. I think a reasonable intelligent person with enough time to review all the evidence would conclude that Amber lied about much of her testimony and her portrayal of events was inaccurate and dishonest. Depp has his issues, but he has generally been honest and open about them. The truth should be defended and Depp should not be vilified based on falsehoods. 

I also think its important not to put Depp on a pedestal. He clearly has a temper, a drug/alcohol problem, and from recordings doesn't sound like a particularly supportive partner. 

I feel like many of his supporters should respect the fact that even if Depp's version of events is completely accurate, Depp did not want Amber to suffer for her actions. He may feel someone more vengeful now, but at the time and afterward he did not feel Amber's actions warranted public shaming, pressing charges, or the demonization we have seen by reddit. 

Ultimately, if Depp's version of events is accurate, he made the choice to be in that relationship. If he did not feel abused I think redditors should respect that.",t1_gg2i5ia,r/awfuleverything,amphibiousParakeet,2020-12-17 00:01:25+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

Honestly, I gotta disagree with the judge. Here's what the Judge's statement was.

> In one of those incidents, in Australia in 2015, Mr Depp was allegedly physically and verbally abusive towards her while drinking heavily and taking drugs. Mr Depp accused Ms Heard of severing his finger, but the judge said he did not accept Ms Heard was responsible.

> ""Taking all the evidence together, I accept that she was the victim of sustained and multiple assaults by Mr Depp in Australia,"" said Mr Justice Nicol.

...His logic was this.

> ""It is a sign of the depth of his rage that he admitted scrawling graffiti in blood from his injured finger and then, when that was insufficient, dipping his badly injured finger in paint and continuing to write messages and other things,"" the judge said.

> ""I accept her evidence of the nature of the assaults he committed against her. They must have been terrifying.""

...That's not evidence that Amber Heard didn't cut off part of his finger though. Him being in an absolute rage over the incident doesn't negate her actions.

The judge just sort of takes her word at face value and gives it far more weight then it deserves in my opinion.

So yeah, that's basically it. I disagree with the assertion made by the court. Judge seems to view Amber Heard as being a victim and Depp the abuser. I find that essentially just ignores all of her behavior. Everything Depp was accused of, Heard did the same to him, with evidence supporting it. 

But the Judge seems to believe Heard was just reacting to Depp's abusive behavior...but that Depp was NOT reacting to HER abusive behavior. Bit of a double standard and part of me is my inclined to believe sexism against male victims of domestic violence played a role in his decision making.

I'm sorry, but I just don't see how Amber can cut part of his finger off, and the Judge's reaction isn't ""Heard assaulted him"" but, ""Depp's reaction to having his finger cut off made Heard fear for her safety, therefore Depp is the abuser."" I haven't read the full court case. So maybe there's some sort of logic or argument he makes in which his decision makes sense. 

As far as I can tell, his logic is essentially that Heard isn't responsible for her own actions and any abusive behavior she does do, it is only her acting in fear or emotional distress caused by Depp. But Depp if acts out of fear or emotional distress, it's used as evidence of how emotionally unstable he is. 

I hope Mr. Depp wins in appeal, but I highly doubt he will. Libel cases are fairly hard to win, even in the British courts. The decision of courts are what they are. But I have to partially disagree with the ruling. I don't think The Sun committed Libel publishing the allegations with the evidence they had available. But I do think Heard is guilty of being a domestic abuser herself.",t1_gg14jqq,r/awfuleverything,Calfurious,2020-12-16 16:18:55+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

Hmmm lets see… Amber Heard physically assaulted Johnny Depp on many occasions, took pictures of him when he was passed out and in shameful positions to shame him, beat him, cut off his fingertip, manipulated him, goaded him into flippping out on camera and shared the footage. She tried to destroy his reputation out of sheer malice and cruelty. And for a while, she succeeded remarkably well, because of his restraint in publicly defending himself and attacking her back.

￼

By contrast, Depp is just a former drunk with substance abuse issues. Loved by all his other exes, his former co-stars, his friends and even his rivals. Not a bad dude, just a dude with issues. He was vulnerable, and she took advantage of him.

People are quick to jump to the aid of the gorgeous, blonde actress. And dismiss and disavow the aging, washed-up drunk actor she married. He’s old, she’s young. He’s rich, she’s not. So the optics aren’t in his favor. She knew this, and she manipulated it brilliantly until Depp became fed up and decided to stand up for himself. Bet she regrets it now!

Well, he did — he fathered two children and has several exes! — but he’s never attacked any women. He likes his whiskey, he has done quite a few drugs in the (not so distant) past. And he’s yelled at and even punched intrusive members of the press before for disrespecting the privacy of his loved ones... At the same time, he’s also a guy who very often visits sick children in hospitals dressed as Jack Sparrow, never announcing his real identity or charging a dime.

￼

Within relationships, there is ZERO history of abuse on Depp’s end. He’s hit some paparazzi, trashed a few hotel rooms, had some drunken brawls… none of this is cancel-worthty — we can cancel the Rolling Stones, half of Hollywood and almost every famous artist for the same reasons, and I think that would be unfair and uncalled for. So, violent guy? Not quite. Guy who likes a drink and sometimes waves his fists or throws a punch at someone for stalking him or his family? Yeah, I’ll give you that. Oh, the horror!

Now lets look at Amber Heard…

Before Depp, she primarily dated women. She physically hit and abused several of her exes. One she even beat so badly that, in 2009, police arrrested Amber Heard at a Seattle airport. Her girlfriend dropped the charges before the case went forward, Heard walked free. There is a pattern here.

Johnny Depp? Zero evidence of violence against women, ever. Amber Heard? Multiple examples of violence against women. If anyone should be #MeToo’d, it should be Amber Heard!

But she wasn’t #MeToo’d. Because Heard is a woman. A beautiful woman, in Hollywood. At the height of a movement that painted every man in the movie- and entertainment industry as ‘potentially abusive’ and went on, endlessly, about how we should “believe all women”. She arrived at the scene with her explosive accusations at the perfect time. And the media absolutely crucified the man.

Just to give you an example of the extreme levels of hatred he faced, here’s a hit-piece[1] by ‘journalist’ Biba Kang from December 2017:

'JK Rowling just betrayed millions of women'

Imagine that! J.K. Rowling, author of Harry Potter, “betrayed millions of women”!

Why, and how, did she “betray millions of women”? Because she gave Johnny Depp the benefit of the doubt. Because she talked to him, when no one would. Because she did not take the accusations of his ex-wife at face value. They wanted her to cut him out of the movie, she’s the creator of the Harry Potter universe so obviously she has a final say in who plays who… they wanted to pressure her, but they misculculated her stubborn nature and overplayed their hand with hysterical hit-pieces. None of it aged particularly well but unlike on Quora[2], no apologises from any of the journalists involved in the blatant character assassination of the actor.

The vitriol and hatred of Johnny Depp was so intense, that even to suggest that maybe there was another side to the story, was pure blasphemy. Betraying millions of women. Choosing between good and evil. Comparisons between Dumbledore and Rowling, insinuating that Depp was somehow a villain of Voldemortian proportions.

Tabloids went ALL OUT. They weren’t subtle at all. Some outright pressured studios to drop Depp from current and future projects. All based solely on hearsay and unfounded accusations by an unstable former wife with an agenda.

￼

Now we know Johnny Depp was really the one who was abused. He was the one hiding his black eyes underneath sunglasses. He was the one hiding the fact that he had his finger cut off from the general public…

But he DID tell J.K. Rowling, and when she faced pressure to have him booted from her movies, she bravely stood by him and refused to budge.

His friends in the industry, they know better. So do his exes. His children. His siblings. His co-stars and the people he’s worked with. His staff. You name it, everyone who knows the man, seems to love him.

Meanwhile, more and more information is coming out about his ex-wife. For example, the fact that she word-for-word copied the account of another woman’s rape. The fact that she goaded her husband into anger, only to film the subsequent outburst and edit out her own taunting. The fact that she cut off his finger. Shat in his bed. Fabricated evidence of rape, sexual and domestic abuse.

￼

I won’t say the man ‘never hurt a fly’. I won’t make him out to be some saint here — he isn’t. But a wifebeater, he isn’t. And Amber Heard, meanwhile, appears to be a real-life ‘Gone Girl’, and Depp her victim.

Hey, #MeToo! If you really want to endorse a victim of domestic abuse? Endorse Johnny Depp! And if you’re looking for an abusive person to cancel… cancel Amber Heard.

I don’t fucking know. What I do know is that evidence shows they’re both toxic. They both have witness testimonies, both have photos of the injuries, they’ve *both assaulted* people (an ex partner, a crew member, a security guard). Johnny Depp even admits that his drug and alcohol issues are extremely problematic and that they fuel his anger.

The Court has statements of case in which Heard made 14 open allegations of assault against Depp; there was also a ""confidential annex"" (and a confidential response) and in the absence of any statement by the court as to why they are confidential we can only speculate. Depp pleaded to each allegation made by Heard setting out how his version of events differs from hers. The Court then heard from about 20 or so witnesses (including Heard and Depp) and then - pay attention here -

*the court had to make a finding of fact in relation of each of those allegations.*

If the Court had found that Heard had failed to convince it in every one of those allegations, it would have had to find that the claim was made out and the Sun would have had to pay damages.

As it was, the Court found that she had failed to 'come up to proof' on only 2 of the open allegations and one of the confidential ones. In other words, the Court found *as a fact* that Depp had assaulted Heard on no fewer than 12 occasions.

**1. That is not what I am doing**, she is both an abuser and a victim.

**2. Even if I was saying that it would not be sexist you imbecile.**

You do know there is evidence of Amber Heard domestically abusing Johnny Depp right? Johnny isn't perfect himself, I am not saying that nor does he.
I am simply pointing out that she is an abuser as well as a victim. Someone who commits domestic violence should not then be giving talks on domestic abuse. Surely you a smart to enough to understand that? Or is that rational conclusion a bit too much for you?

Here is an audio recording of a conversation between Johnny and Amber: https://youtu.be/0oe2Tfix9-k

Here is a video recording of Amber smiling, laughing, rolling her eyes etc as she listens to audio recordings (note how bored she looks, eating away like it just another day. Doesn't look like too much of how a real domestic abuse victim would act listening to recordings. It would be a traumatic experience): https://youtu.be/qD5OeOKkhXM

In this video, Johnny is angry and aggressively opening cabinets etc which I do not condone. However, this shows how much of a sneaky, lying snake she is. Sets up a camera, covering it so he doesn't see it and it trying to get him to do something to her so she can go ""see what he did!"":
https://youtu.be/V7lg69VFSY8

Notice at 1:30 she points out and says ""have you drunk this whole thing this morning"". This couldn't be more obvious of a set up The way she speaks it is just so snidey. Trying to play the look at me I'm so innocent.

First you repeat your narrative ""who is the victim? I don't know!!"" 

If it seemed like the victim was Amber (which at one point it did), you'd be ramming that down everyone's throat. But since the victim is actually Johnny, your take is ""i don't know who the victim is! They must both be abusive!""

**The victim is Johnny Depp**. A man who lost roles from mere allegations and had his finger amputated from a known abuser with a history of domestic abuse. **You don't give a fuck about domestic abuse victims, you care about pushing a narrative.**

Feminists do. People like you. Go take a look at /r/feminism for the fancy wordplay they use to blame men for everything and absolve women of any responsibility, just like you're doing right now.

>You weren’t in the relationship, I wasn’t there either

But if we had audio of Johnny Depp saying anything slightly as incriminating as Amber Heard has said, you'd be screaming in the street about what an abusive POS Johnny is and demanding he lose roles. Oh wait, that already happened...

I was also aware of the alleged City of Lies crew member incident. Last I heard, the case has been postponed until 2021, but from what I have seen in public testimony, Brooks sounds like he is full of shit and Depp looks like an incredibly nice guy. (see script supervisor's statement)

I was unaware of the 1989 security guard incident until today when someone told me about it. In Depp's defense, the security guard David Sulina said regarding Depp's complete discharge that Sulina thought the verdict was “fair. It wasn’t a major assault.”

I am aware Depp trashed a hotel room with Kate Moss in the 90s. He accepted full responsibility for the damages. Kate Moss's 2012 interview with Vanity Fair seems to describe Depp quite positively. 

Depp has trashed various other objects, rooms, houses, etc. An old quote from Depp:

> *Some* guys *play golf*, *some* guys smash *hotel rooms*

To me, smashing objects is meaningfully different from physically assaulting someone. Some might find such behavior too scary to be around but evidence suggests that Amber did not feel that way (she engaged in this behavior as well and did not appear to be scared in the recordings). 

If you are aware of some incident of domestic violence that I am not aware of I would love it know about it. I have googled quite a bit and not been able to find any. 

Amber assaulted an ex and allegedly assaulted her sister. Here is Amber talking about herself in an interview:

>Whenever my old friends meet someone I'm involved with romantically, they immediately warn them, 'She may look refined, but when she's angry, she can go trailer park really fast.'

Meanwhile, testimony of witnesses to Amber and Depps' arguments describe Depp as trying to leave the situation. Leave the room, leave the house, trying to get away. That comes from multiple eye witnesses. Amber actually complained about this behavior on one of the recordings.

Men are naturally more violent. Violence is to men, as Sexuality is to women. That's what testosterone does.

Johnny Depp is a drug addicted, alcoholic, psychopath. He has been a hot hollywood actor his entire adult life. He has hundreds of millions of dollars. He beat his wife, abused his staff, and threatened to kill a dog. The list of crazy shit Johnny Depp has done is exhaustive. I'm not gonna type it all.

Amber Heard is also crazy but not nearly as much. If you doubt that then just watch the only direct evidence we have of any of this which is a video of johnny depp abusing her. Or observe the picture of his bloody screed he wrote on the mirror of her apartment with his severed finger. He is clearly the power figure in the relationship both on paper and in all the evidence. Which is why Amber Heard filed a restraining order and got the fuck out of dodge. It's not unusual for abusive relationships to be a two way street in terms of yelling and hitting and name calling. But there is also typically a power imbalance. And someones toxicity is driving it all. It's impossible to view the evidence as it is and come away saying that Amber Heard is that toxic force. Or even that this was an even exchange of violence and abuse. If it was then Depp wouldn't have pursued her after the restraining order. He would have just stayed the fuck away. And if you still aren't sure about that then just consider that a judge heard every fucking terrible detail over an excruciating long trial from several witnesses on all sides and came away with the opinion that Depp was factually a wife beater.

However if you read the article I posted it explicitly stated that Depp's lawyers formed a plan for their lawsuit which is to frame Heard as orchestrating a grand conspiracy to smear Depp's image and ruin his career. Does that sound familiar? That's because that same conspiracy is constantly being posted here over and over with red arrows and photos and text. This shit is being pushed by Johnny's PR team. 62k upvotes and 40 awards. Give me a fucking break. Of course it's way easier to get away with it when you have an army of incels who just absolutely fucking love this conspiracy because it makes women look like liars. They always attack you for 'not caring about abuse' but the truth is they don't care about abuse. They are just riding this propoganda wave till it breaks because it suits their narrative perfectly. A beautiful woman beat a beloved actor and framed him to ruin his career? What's not to love! 

So yeah, these Amber Heard posts exist here for one purpose only. To provide cover for a wife beater and to further the incel agenda. And because incels argue in bad faith the only thing that is appropriate to do is just drink their tears when they cry about being called out. They are either incels or idiots defending incels so there is no reason to engage that shit any other way.",t1_gg2oxk5,r/awfuleverything,AverageLiberalJoe,2020-12-16 22:17:17+00:00,[],Negative,Neutral

 Johnny Depp is being blacklisted for the way he handled the whole situation. Basically, he complained about the situation and semi publicly burned a few people who may or may not have been sleeping with his (ex?)wife.

Like my understanding of the bigger picture was she was physically abusive, but then he was verbally abusive well past the point of harassment to everyone who was unfortunate enough to be around him during all this. Hence, the UK abuse thing. There was ample evidence that they were *both* abusive, just in different ways.

There were 14 open incidents in which Heard claims Depp assaulted her, together with one or more ""confidential"" incidents. The judgment doesn't say why they were held ""confidential"", but one possibility is that they were allegations of sexual impropriety. (Could be something else.)

The Court found that of those 14 incidents, 12 of them were made out to the civil standard, with 2 not made out and at least one of the allegations in the ""confidential annex"" not made out either.

If you read the judgment, you will see why the Court accepted which evidence it was given: for example, photographs supposedly taken on specific dates were later acknowledged to have been taken on different dates; the police officers who claimed not to have seen any sign of injury on Amber Heard took no contemporary notes and were not asked to give depositions for at least two months, at which time they said they had been in Depp's apartment for 60 minutes when the CCTV camera footage showed that they were there less than 15 minutes and they had to admit they had not been nearer to Amber Heard than 20 feet.

As I've said elsewhere, this trial only considered whether Depp was a 'wife beater'; it did not consider whether Heard was a husband beater.

My answer was a bit more nuanced than that.

Like answer this question for me please. Did Amber Heard cut off part of Johnny's Depp's finger?

If she did...she committed domestic assault. You can't really just overlook that. The only argument that you could have in contrary to that, is that Depp cut off his own finger. But he didn't do that and not even the judge said he did, only that he acted erratically after suffering the injury. 

So I'm having a hard time with you and the judge, saying Amber Heard is not a domestic abuser, when violently assaulted her husband. I don't know what else you want me to say. Unless I'm missing some sort of piece of critical information, I don't understand how anybody could argue otherwise.

Furthermore, the opinion of the judge being what it is, I would like ot state the court case was not about Amber Heard being a domestic abuser, it's about whether she lied and portrayed her relationship with Depp in a false light and that The Sun knew this, and still published the story. 

So even if we were take everything at face value, the court case only concludes Depp is an abuser. It doesn't act as a defense to Amber Heard also being an abuser herself. Which is the issue people have with her.",t1_gg1kr96,r/awfuleverything,Calfurious,2020-12-16 16:35:12+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

Make any argument you want but the majority of the internet is against Heard. It's obvious she's the abuser. There is no use arguing against an idiot since they think they're always right.

Putting aside the awful rag that is the sun, here's something from the BBC:

Jenny Afia of Schillings law firm, who represented Mr Depp, said: ""This decision is as perverse as it is bewildering.

""Most troubling is the judge's reliance on the testimony of Amber Heard, and corresponding disregard of the mountain of counter-evidence from police officers, medical practitioners, her own former assistant, other unchallenged witnesses and an array of documentary evidence which completely undermined the allegations, point by point.""

""The judgement is so flawed that it would be ridiculous for Mr Depp not to appeal this decision,"" she added.

But if anyone is better at working out whether someone's evidence is not really true, it would be English civil judges. They do it day in, day out.

Although they relied on Heards statement, that's a reasonable approach to take given that's what the Sun's claim is based on.

If you remove all the names and status and stigma, what you get is 

- Famous woman accuses famous husband of abusing her

- ""newspaper"" reports on this and uses a salatious term to describe husband on the back of these accusations.

- Husband sues newspaper for defamation.

- under defamation law in the UK, he has to prove that the statement was defamatory in nature. He can't really do this because his wife states that he did xyz, and it's pretty damn hard to disprove you did xyz in the privacy of your own home. 

- Court finds its reasonable for the newspaper to print it when the accusation was made by the alleged victim, there's no legal case in our jurisdiction absolving him, and he can't prove it was defamatory by virtue of it being untrue.

The finding is reasonable, as is relying on Heards statement, both in the case of the Sun and the Courts, because the Sun's claim is effectively that she said it happened to her, and that's good enough unless he can prove otherwise.

The problems as you've said, is that none of this actually proves he's a wife beater. It just proves you can call him a wife beater because his wife says he beat her and that accusation is such that he can't really prove he DIDNT do something.

It's like if you tell your mates you're having a quiet night in, and the next thing you know your missus is telling them she caught you wanking off to your dead nans photo album or something.

The court didn't find that Depp was abusive, the court found that the Daily Mail was not committing malicious slander when they said he committed abuse.

Well, yes. You have to distinguish between findings of fact and the judgment on the claim. It was necessary for the court to find whether Depp was a ""wife beater"" in order for it to make judgment on the claim, viz. that there had been no libel. 

A newspaper doesn't have 'beliefs', it has no mind. 

This is what the judge said about what was referred to as 'Incident 1':

>210: Seen in isolation, the evidence that Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard on this occasion might not be sufficient. However, taken with the evidence as a whole, I find that it did occur.  

This is a finding that ""Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard"". There are other findings with respect to other Incidents.

If you want to check for yourself, [here's](https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/depp-v-news-group-newspapers-ltd/) the judgment in full.

That's not the part that's ambiguous. What's ambiguous is whether she's the instigator/abuser/what-have-you in the relationship, or whether those were instances of self-defense/retaliation against the person who was regularly the instigator/abuser/what-have-you, or whether they're both shitty abusive people beating up on each other.

The ""nobody will believe you"" recording - that could be an abusive person trying to intimidate her victim into silence, or it could be the victim standing up to her abuser by telling him people aren't going to believe his [DARVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO) attempt, or it could, again, just be two shitty people both trying to weaponize the courts and public opinion in their ongoing personal grudge-fest.

These things are tricky, rarely as clear-cut as attention-grabbing/inflammatory headlines and commentary make them out to be, and usually require extensive, meticulous examination and sorting out of *all* the evidence, including that which the internet mob probably doesn't have available, to come to an appropriate conclusion.

She called the cops. They arrested me for domestic violence because in MA that's the law. I went to court, fought it, showed the DA the texts, and won because they dropped the case after seeing the text messages and her deciding not to be a witness. 

It took only a little energy to fix my social reputation. Luckily, most people were aware of her alcoholism, and luckily my own personality is such that people didn't think I would hit her. 

I almost lost my degree (this was senior year) and my job.

In the Sun libel case Depp first denied about headbutting her, but later he himself agreed that he headbutted and physically assaulted her.

He himself accepted that he used to be so blackout drunk that he used to have no control over his actions and can't deny the said physical assualt allegations. 

What kind of circumstances could justify a man fantasizing with his friends about how he would like to fuck his wife's burnt corpse ?

There is a statement which says that Depp himself said to the doctor that he cut the fingers himself, it's the doctors own testament.

Before the trial, I was somewhat on Depp's side. The evidence that both sides' PA teams had put in play seemed to suggest that he was more sinned against than sinning.

But reading the judgment (in case you don't: the judge summarises what the two sides say about each of the 14 incidents in turn, then he examines the evidence he heard in respect of each of the incidents in turn, giving his finding at the end of each summary) changed my mind.

Most of the time the pro-Depp evidence evaporated - such as the two police officers who attended the last incident, and gave evidence that they saw no marks or injuries on Amber Heard - turns out they don't remember the incident that well (they said they had been at the apartment for 60 minutes when CCTV footage showed they were there less than 15) and they didn't make any contemporary notes of the incident (I don't know about you but I thought the police always made notes of these things...?) and so the judge felt the evidence provided by Amber Heard's witnesses was more reliable. (Judges who don't worship police evidence - whatever next?) Regarding the poo on the bed - this was found by the maid on a day after Depp had left that property and was not expecting to return while Heard would be remaining there; the judge reasonably pointed out that shitting on the bed is a pretty stupid way of trying to 'get at' someone who is never going to see it. He doesn't say so but it seems somewhat more likely that Depp did it to get at Heard.

I've always liked Johnny Depp as an actor, and as a person - he visited kids in hospital in the UK dressed as his pirate character - but it seems that drink and drugs made him a pretty unpleasant character at least during his relationship with Heard.",t1_gg66wrj,r/awfuleverything,faithle55,2020-12-18 07:56:15+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

No the court did NOT find it factually correct to call him a wife beater. The court did not even address that label because it’s not even a statement of fact so cannot be the basis for a libel case.

Are you familiar with [Duluth's Power & Control Model](https://www.theduluthmodel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PowerandControl.pdf)? That's the framework used on an institutional level within the United States, to incarcerate perpetrators of domestic abuse. Notice how only males are framed as the actors?  Men have no access to domestic abuse shelters, despite research indicating that domestic abuse against men is almost at parity with women. ^[11](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/110127/dq110127a-eng.htm)  In addition to that, the entire court system in the United States strongly favors women. Some studies [indicate a 60-65% disparity](https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx) between male and female sentences for the exact same crimes. U.S prisons are comprised of 95% men.

Maybe that’s annoying for you, but you’ll have to deal with it anyway. Duluth’s Power and Control Model only addresses women and that is an issue because again, anyone can be abused. I mean you see Amber Heard, she got away with being an abuser. There was physical evidence, past exes who talked about her violence, voice recordings, etc. and Johnny was still the one who lost his entire career. 

But, I can explain why the model only makes women seem the victim. Domestic violence has been primarily against women since pre-historic ages. Women have always been seen as weaker. Violence against women is high: female genocide, 33% of women die under the hands of their husbands/partners, 70% of human trafficking victims are girls. That’s why feminism even exists today. But now, we’re starting to realize that men can go through awful things, that men can be emotional, etc. Another thing to note is that 90% of men who were abused by a woman were verbally abused. Emotional abuse and manipulation is hard to prove. You have no evidence. For the domestic violence shelters, 21 out of 26 shelters are for women & children only. 4 out of 25 shelters inclusive to everyone. Men don’t have support groups like women, and a lot of times men don’t have support within their communities— mainly their guy friends, parents, etc. You seem to think I don’t know this & I don’t get why. 

The justice system and courts are messed up. They are messed up for every victim, every offender, every abuser. The justice system has always favored the white and the wealthy. For example, Jeffery Epstein raped a young girl who was 13. He only served 8 months prison time the first time. The second time, they found out he was sex trafficking and put him in prison only for him to “die”. (He was either killed, or they’re hiding him.) They will always favor a straight, white, wealthy man, over a black, gay, homeless one. Rape against anyway is rarely penalized. Only 6% of rapists are ever prosecuted and only 1% even serve time.

Why are you being so aggressive towards me? I wasn't being sarcastic or anything. I genuinely wanted to hear your perspective... 

> I can explain why the model only makes women seem the victim. Domestic violence has been primarily against women since pre-historic ages.

Do we even know that? Hear me out... Like, men don't report their grievances. Pretty much ever. Especially in the context of relationships. I certainly don't. There are tons of statistics demonstrating this. Which is why I think deferring to those ""studies"" saying x crime disproportionately affects women is kind of ridiculous. We know for a fact that very few men would ever publicly disclose any instance of domestic violence. So how can you confidently assess that women were the primary victims of domestic violence?

Included in my citations for my prior comment were statistics from the Canadian government via social survey:

> A similar proportion of men and women reported experiencing spousal violence during the five years prior to the survey. Among men, 6.0% or about 585,000, encountered spousal violence during this period, compared with 6.4% or 601,000 women.

Among that, you agreed that the judicial system doesn't protect men adequately. Why would I, as a man, setting aside my biological predisposition for stoicism, subject myself to a process that is popularly regarded as unjust? What incentive do I have to do that? Availability bias

I will say that *yes*, women throughout history *were* in a position of inferior rank. Though, relate this to the present, are they currently? The past doesn't matter imo. For all intensive purposes, the past doesn't even really exist. It's an illusion. It has no bearing on the present. Should we be paying reparations for our ancestors crimes?

I think that would cause other problems. If the scales have been balanced (equal opportunity, which they have in at least *some* respects) then granting one demographic preferential amenities based on historical treatment would inherently disenfranchise another demographic. 

I'm not attacking you. I'm just saying this phenomenon isn't exclusively (or even mostly) affecting women. It's actually pretty even. If we actually allowed both sexes access to the same shelters, and stopped segregating them (a larger critique of mine regarding both men's rights and feminism) then we could actually address the damn problem.

So, it’s not just a man’s issue, but it’s about class, race, gender, and religion.

I don't really agree. There are definitely demographics that are brazenly discriminated against in our court system. Men are subjected to 63% longer sentences for the same exact crimes. I don't know why people keep neglecting that statistic. That's absolutely incredible. Black men would be subjected to roughly 10-15% longer than even that.

I don’t know how to do the reply to certain parts of ur comments on Reddit (I’m relevantly new to this whole thing), so I’m going to go in order for the most part. 

1. We know that because of history and centuries of oppression. We know that because in the 1950s abuse was still normalized, this being a western country. We know this because those studies are a world wide statistic— even statistically speaking most countries, women are more like subjected to abuse and harassment. You’re right about men speaking up, and that is something I talk about over and over again. Men who have to internalize emotions are more likely to grow up to be abusers, depressed, suicidal, addicts, and more. 

2. Yes, the judicial system does affect everyone. It’s a court system biased to everyone. Prisons were invented to keep slaves or freed black people locked up. Black men are 3.4x more likely to get falsely imprisoned over white men. Is it fair to them? Is it fair to them? You will always be disadvantaged in most situations because of subconscious bias and stereotypes.

3. I don’t agree with this statement at all. The past breeds the future. The past is the literal cause for the way the world is today. Why do you think that men don’t feel like they can speak up? Because historically, they were seen as weak and not a man. Even the men who fought in WW2 and came back with ptsd were described as crazy. Why do you think that women aren’t in more man-dominated jobs like stem work, manual labor? Why do you think that black people still face racism? I think you should watch Dark. It’s a dystopian tv show that talks about the how the past, present, and future all impact each other. It’s kind of confusing but an amazing show.  Or search up the butterfly effect.

I just don't agree with that... And I don't know how you can confidently say that, while agreeing with me that men are biologically predisposed to be stoic. I continue to believe that the distribution is fairly equal.

 There are movements out there working to change that sentencing gap for black people. Why does no such movement exist for men, with such a significant gap of 63%? I'm going to continue repeating that statistic, regardless of whether you acknowledge it, because I think it's remarkable.

Women DO go through more harassment. I mean catcalling is extremely common in a lot of major cities. I’ve lived in NYC for years and even as an 11 year old child, men used to say weirdly sexual things & one tried touching me that I had to walk only with my male family members or bring pepper spray? Or especially with dates. As a guy (unless you’re not straight), do you send your friends locations of where you’re going? Do you send them pics of how the girl looks like or when they should check up on you? This is extra safety precaution for women and a lot of gay guys. This is a problem mostly women and girls face. 63% of human trafficking victims & 96% of sex trafficking victims are girls. And a majority of predators— pedos, rapists, assaulters (groping, molestation, etc.) are MEN. This is something you can’t deny. 90% of rapists against women are men, and 93% of rapists against men are men. 85% of physically abusive partners are men. 65% of pedophiles are men. 

Even though a lot of guys don’t speak up about their experiences which skews the statistics for almost everything, you have to remember that a lot of girls also don’t speak up about their experiences as well. So, if we actually got every single assault allegation, both numbers would rise. 

This is not an attack on the male specimen as a whole, but an eye opener. In order to fix a majority of our world day problems, we have to focus on the root cause.

Maybe you don’t see it, but I do. I just hardly ever comment because when I do a lot of people come for me. Haha. The guy who posts on this subreddit is fine, but the people who comment under it are the issues.

Your philosophy will never change these problems. Your philosophy is predicated on prejudice. Your philosophy fails to take the male perspective into consideration. Your movement has stagnated and reached a wall because you aren't willing to hear alternative perspectives. 

I'll use pedophilia as an example since you mentioned it. The common solution to this problem from the feminist perspective is to bury these people. But this actually reinforces the problem. Because non-offenders that haven't committed any aggression are too scared to concede that they need help out of fear. Same involving men with rape fantasies (a *whole lot* of men).

Biologically men are more aggressive, obviously. They also have a higher libido. So you think — oh, men must be the problem! Have you considered that the way you perceive men is the problem? The fact that men are ostracized and raised with the impression that they are a sexual predator?

It's the premise that the sexes should be treated equally. I think this is a reoccurring problem I often see in this debate linguistically. People conflate feminism with women's rights. *Women's rights* is also a static concept. The idea of advocating for women. That's something that I would subscribe to. I would however not subscribe to the ideology of feminism. Which is ever-changing, and beholden to the views of that movement's constituents. 

> I never implied you were the problem.

I think that's an oversight on your part. One of the reoccurring notions I've seen from people that advocate for men's rights is that they often feel blamed for all the ills of society. Again, I'll defer to linguistics. *Fem-* as a root word is gynocentric. *Patriarchy* describes males, *toxic masculinity* refers to immutable characteristics possessed by males, *rape culture* implies that raping is a pervasive trend among males. In every circumstance, my existence is deemed the fundamental problem. 

You can't relate to that. You don't know what it's like to advocate for your issues, and then enter every single conversation with the underlying impression that the other person perceives your existence to be problematic. Or your concerns to be trivial. 

I think that [Cassie Jaye](https://youtu.be/T-aiiDrEuhE) illustrated this point better than I ever could. I edited out a clip from *The Red Pill* to demonstrate my point better.

What if I suggested that women are inherently prone to deception? Sure, seems like *some* women are. There is always that insinuation though, that *you* are as well. Naturally you would become defensive. Men *are* more prone to violence. I said that plainly. But I think it's the *WRONG APPROACH* to tell every single young boy (like I was told) not to be a rapist. That makes them afraid of women. That makes them socially isolate themselves. That makes them sexually dysfunctional. That makes weak, and vulnerable, and unable to communicate with women normally. In essence, it facilitates the problem. 

> If you have evidence to back up that women cause a lot of issues, systemically, economically, and are historically oppressive, then go right on ahead.

Why would I do that? And perpetuate this useless cycle of bickering? I would facilitate a dialogue. I would drop any labels or tribalism. And I would purely address the issue itself.

It's ok if we're hopelessly disparate politically. I'm not gonna change your mind. You're not gonna change mine. I just wish men had a voice in the first place. Cause right now, we don't. If I try to organize protestors will be there. If I try to upload videos they will be taken down. If I try to do literally anything publicly to advocate for my issues people with attack me. That's another thing you just can't relate to.

The patriarchy was caused by men that leaves MEN in power (men dominated work forces especially the gov. that dictates our policies) Toxic masculinity is when extremely aggressive, entitled, men enforces the stereotype that men are stoic and emotionless. It harms men who embrace their more feminine side, wear different attire, and attracted to the same gender. What is common denominator in all of this? OTHER MEN.

Sites like Reddit are mostly on Depps side so no one is really hearing everything. Depp does have a case against Amber currently in court so once that is ruled on I think it will become more clear.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

#Please do not message us about this, we need the minimum karma filter to prevent spam. Thank you

Hello, your submission have been removed because the title isn't loopish enough.  Please repost and begin your question with one of the following phrases:

* ""What's going on with""

* ""What is going on with""

* ""What's up with""

* ""What is up with""

* ""Why are people talking about""

* ""Why have people been talking about""

* ""What's the deal with""

* ""What is the deal with""

**Please see Rule 1**

Don't forget to include a URL link for more context in the body of the post, and always end your question with a question mark.

**If your title still doesn't work after using one of these phrases, be aware that you may be using the wrong type of apostrophe (known glitch with automod).  Just try reposting with ""what is"" instead of ""what's"".**

The UK is notorious for being beneficial to libel plaintiffs, to the extent that libel tourism became a thing. Unlike places like the US, in the UK Depp is assumed to be innocent of the Sun's claim and the Sun had to prove, in court, that their statements are correct. For Depp to lose a libel case in the UK is a huge red flag. That's why he's being dropped. Because a court proved him to be a wifebeater

The only reason a huge, multimillionaire star and lead actor in a major movie franchise would get dropped in Hollywood is if they couldn't insure him any more. And a lot of the reasons why a person would be deemed too costly to insure would be drug/alcohol addiction, particularly of the variety that makes a person unable to work in a reliable fashion, especially in an industry like Hollywood, where time is fucking everything. Johnny Depp has been late, holding up shooting, and a lot of the time, refuses to show up for commitments he promises he'd show up for. If you don't fucking show up for work, you'll get fired.

But even that could be excusable, provided he had a team who could get him to where he needs to be on time, or if there are people in the industry who are powerful enough and capable enough to vouch for him, in spite of all that. Except Johnny Depp has been spending the better part of the last few years burning bridges with anyone who could bother to defend him. [This article says it all:](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion)

>""One studio executive who has worked with Depp in recent years says  his inner demons had long ago bled into his professional life, making  him ""a huge liability"" thanks to frequent tardiness and costly behavior,  all cataloged in the U.K. suit.  
>  
>""The discovery that came out in that trial alone would be enough to scare any studio,"" says the executive."" 

And he has a shitty team of professionals to run his life:

>To many observers, Depp's negative press was largely avoidable and  stemmed from his aggressive legal tactics. The chief architect behind  Depp's sue-'em-all strategy is Adam Waldman, a handsome Washington  lawyer with his own sheen of controversy given a clientele that has  included Russian oligarchs and Julian Assange. Waldman, who is married  to Berlin-based jet-setter and luxury skin-care entrepreneur Barbara  Sturm, conducts himself in an unorthodox manner, mocking his legal  opponents on Twitter. Sources say Depp met Waldman through Saudi Arabian  Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the country's powerful minister of energy,  in summer 2016. (Depp spent time aboard the prince's megayacht in the  past.)

And this was after he fired his agent of three decades, sued his long term business manager, and also sued his entertainment lawyer and supposed ""father figure."" 

Not only that, but because he's proceeding with the legal actions against Heard in America now, there's a chance he'll be asked to air not just his dirty laundry, but that of other people as well. So he's been burning down bridges and pissing on the ashes as well, and he has surrounded himself by some of the worst people to be with right now. None of this leaves studio execs much room for optimism.",t1_gf6ixmn,r/SubredditDrama,MissionStatistician,2020-12-10 03:31:54+00:00,[{'display_url': 'https://www.hollywoodreporter.com'}],Positive,Neutral

The ruling in this case was based on 12/14 incidents meeting the cibil threshold in the opinion of the judge (who also happens to have a conflict of interest with the publication if you kept up).

The Defamation Act 2013 (c 26) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which reformed English defamation law on issues of the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation. It also comprised a response to perceptions that the law as it stood was giving rise to libel tourism and other inappropriate claims. The Act changed existing criteria for a successful claim, by requiring claimants to show actual or probable serious harm (which, in the case of for-profit bodies, is restricted to serious financial loss), before suing for defamation in England or Wales, setting limits on geographical relevance, removing the previous presumption in favour of a trial by jury, and curtailing sharply the scope for claims of continuing defamation (in which republication or continued visibility constitutes ongoing renewed defamation). It also enhanced existing defences, by introducing a defence for website operators hosting user-generated content (provided they comply with a procedure to enable the complainant to resolve disputes directly with the author of the material concerned or otherwise remove it), and introducing new statutory defences of truth, honest opinion, and ""publication on a matter of public interest"" or privileged publications (including peer reviewed scientific journals), to replace the common law defences of justification, fair comment, and the Reynolds defence respectively.

Or why you think that this somehow make the whole issue ""less about patriarchy"". Or why you think that women, and their participation in the cult of celebrity, is somehow also not an effect of a patriarchal society, particularly what sorts of relationships it teaches women to value above all else, and how that, in turn, affects how women treat other women. Or why you're seemingly operating under the impression (correct me if I'm wrong), that women themselves can't be some of the most stringent upholders of patriarchal standards in the first place (while simultaneously benefiting from the relaxation of those same standards). 

Women can, and overwhelmingly do, support the same patriarchal structures of abuse that oppress them. There are a lot of reasons for this, including but not limited to the fact that 1) women are taught, first and foremost, to strive for male approval, 2) other women are competitors and not people to stand in solidarity with, 3) acquiescing and perpetuating patriarchal standards has some benefits for women, namely that it allows them to get the approval of men (see point one), and 4) not every woman is harmed by the patriarchy in the same way, some women are able to insulate themselves from some of the effects which prevents them from empathizing with those who can't do the same.

Women overall benefit less from the patriarchy, and they are certainly harmed by it to a greater extent. But it doesn't stop being misogyny just because a woman does it, and it doesn't stop them from perpetuating those ideas (even as it simultaneously harms them). Women who support Johnny Depp feel there is a greater payoff to be had by defending an alcoholic man who beat his wife than there is to seeing the situation with nuance. They see nothing wrong with it because that's what they have been taught. We are all living in a society that conditions people to excuse certain types of behaviour that would be unacceptable, as long as it's a certain *type* of person who does it.

**This is straight up bullshit**. Under english libel law, the ONLY thing that can prevent the Sun from having to pay damages is if they can prove what they wrote is correct. The onus is on them to prove that (and that is what makes it favorable to the plaintiff), and if they can't prove that, they lose the lawsuit. What you said could have been possible for a US libel suit, it's not for a UK one.

> Nothing was proven or even close to proven at all. Just there is enough there to not make the newspaper pay damages to depp. 

Except the ruling by the judge explicitly states that  of the 14 alleged assaults denied by Depp, 12 of them were proven to a sufficient extent by the Sun. This is such an easily verifiable fact that I question if people like you are just intentionally lying. literally no publication that reported on the lawsuit's result wouldn't have stated this.

Depp got the blowback he did because people making decisions actually understands what it means to lose such a case in the UK. It wouldnt have happened if it were lost in the US.

That's very passionate opinion but its also not how British libel laws work. There are five defenses against defamation in the UK, truth is only one.

I did manage to find the actual judgement: [https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Judgment-FINAL.pdf](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Judgment-FINAL.pdf)

The Sun chose to rely solely on the defense of truth in this case. However the judge notes that the defendant must only show that what they said is more likely true than false. They don't have to ""prove"" it to a very strict standard.

Also the case doesn't seem to consider the meaning of the term ""wife beater"" at all (though its long and I only skimmed to see what the defense used was). If Depp was abused and defending himself he may have hit Heard but that would hardly make him a wife beater. I think that's the real salient issue here.

Like if someone had a boxing match against a gay person would The Sun really be allowed to call them a ""gay basher""?

The Kobe case was dropped by the victim because she was getting harassed by Kobe's fans...they threatened her and she ended up attempting to take her own life due to the constant barrage of harassment.

Why was that not the first hypothetical you jump to, instead of this?

Because that is the topic of the conversation? It is absolutely possible that Heard was the abused but we're talking about what this ruling that actually happened means.

The ruling considers only the claim that he ""hit his wife"" and that she ""feared for her life"". That's different from the accusation that people have a problem with which is specifically Depp being a wife beater. If people believe Depp's story that Heard abused him then this ruling makes no difference, it doesn't prove that he was an abuser it only proves that he was sometimes violent. Abused people lashing out is a thing.

Doing a search for the phrase ""wife beater"" suggests that the judge specifically discarded this because the article headline was changed and neither party chose to mention that.

The physical facts aren't the story that people care about here. If I publish a story that says ""psychopath dismembers old lady"" and what happened is that she had a leg amputated by a surgeon I can defend myself on the literal fact that the doctor dismembered the old lady. However people who believe the doctor didn't do anything wrong don't have to change their mind just because I ""proved in a court of law"" that my claims were true.

Judges don’t just rule that it’s *not libelous* to call someone a wife beater for no reason. That judgment was based on evidence. 

For example, ‘A text from Depp to CAA agent Christian Carino, who previously repped Heard, in which he wrote: ""[Heard is] begging for total global humiliation. She's gonna get it. I'm gonna need your texts about San Francisco brother … I'm even sorry to ask … But she sucked [Elon Musk's] crooked d-ck and he gave her some sh-tty lawyers … I have no mercy, no fear and not an ounce of emotion or what I once thought was love for this gold digging, low level, dime a dozen, mushy, pointless dangling overused flappy fish market … I'm so f—-ing happy she wants to fight this out!!! She will hit the wall hard!!! And I cannot wait to have this waste of a c-m g-zzler out of my life!!! I met f—-ing sublime little Russian here … Which makes me realize the time I blew on that 50 cent stripper … I wouldn't touch her with a goddam glove.""’

‘In another text to actor Paul Bettany, Depp writes, ""Let's burn Amber!!!"" To which Bettany, apparently taking it as a joke, responds, ""Having thought it through I don't think we should burn Amber — she's delightful company and easy on the eye, plus I'm not sure she's a witch. We could of course try the English course of action in these predicaments ­— we do a drowning test. Thoughts?"" Depp adds, ""Let's drown her before we burn her!!! I will f—k her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she's dead.""’

Women can be just as abusive as men.

I think OPs mother isn't just Amber Heard supporter but an extrem feminist.

I am not against feminism but like every other group or foundation or movement there are people that take it very seriously and when they take it seriously they go to extremes to achieve what they want.

I maybe be wrong but the way this world is going i doubt that there is majority that is neutral in any case not just feminism nor any other movements but in general.

Johnny depp was right she gave a statement which supported Johnnys allegetions but bc Amber has connections with the judge one way or another she can't be an abuser by the ruling of the judge.

Sorry for hurting someone or angering any women/men who support feminist movement i support too but i condem those who go to the extrem.

The \*itch was also known for sleeping with anything with a penis, so she probably was sleeping with the police chief.  My parents refused to push the issue because ""it won't bring him back.""

She dared to show up at the funeral.  I made such a scene that her lone friend drug her out of the service.

On the plus side, she lost custody of her kids to their biological father.  She was literally ran out of town and had to leave the state due to numerous death threats.  She has served time for money laundering.

Stagnetti finds the secret ""staff"" unlocked by Isabella's husband Manuel.After the crew escapes the spawn of darkness summoned by Stagnetti, their ship engages Stagnetti's in battle, ending Stagnetti's reign as a pirate.

https://www.tmz.com/2016/06/02/johnny-depp-assistant-denies-text-messages-amber-heard/

Apparently Amber also accused Depp of the assault during the texts in question and shared multiple photos of herself with visible injuries after requesting a restraining order. However when the police were called to the scene over a domestic call they found no evidence of any physical injuries after examining her. I do not know though if these were the same text messages used in the court case with the Sun tabloid defending their use of the term wife beater or a different set of texts sent between them. 

However she’s fabricated so much evidence and made so many claims, I can see why people are skeptical of her claims, and also why they’ll be appealing the verdict. Her also being arrested for physically abusing a previous partner prior to this whole shitshow with Johnny Depp is also concerning.

Heard alledges Depp got jealous of James Franco, who she as shooting a movie with, and on a plane got fucked up on various drugs, beat her, then passed out in the bathroom.

Depp had said he remembers the flight very well and nothing happened. His security said he was quietly drawing, maaaybe gave her a little ""love tap"" at most and eventually went to the bathroom.

Then you have some text messages:

Depp:

> I’ve been so busy with film here in Boston then back to L.A. for kiddies ... When
> I was in NYC ... They were brief visits, and fucked and charged by horrific flights
> with Amber ... **I fucked up and drank and got shitty.** Was so disappointed in myself.

Another one: 

> ‘I’m gonna properly stop the booze thing, darling ... Drank all night before I picked
> Amber up to fly to LA this past Sunday ... Ugly, mate ... No food for days ...
> Powders ... Half a bottle of Whiskey, a thousand red bull and vodkas pills, 2 bottles
> of Champers on plane and what do you get ... ??? **An angry, aggro injun in a fuckin
> blackout, screaming obscenities and insulting any fuck who gets near... I’m done.
> I am admittedly too fucked in the head to spray my rage at the one I love.** For little
> reason I’m too old to be that guy But, pills are fine!!!.’
> 

Security:

> ‘Hey. He’s up. He’s much better. Clearer. **He doesn’t remember much, but we took
> him thru all that happened. He’s sorry.** Very sorry

So clearly the statement that it was a quiet flight and he remembers everything was a straight lie.

The next day he apologized to her and mentions him kicking her, both himself and through his security. Their explanation now became that they only told her what she wanted to hear to calm her down. Which not only doesn't match their previous statement that nothing had been going on, but also makes no sense given Depp would later tell friends how badly he behaved on that flight as well.

> 
> ‘There feels like a sea change in him this morning. He just spoke about how bad he
> feels and he wasn’t talking physically ... **He’s incredibly apologetic and knows that 
> he has done wrong.** He wants to get better now. He’s been very explicit about that
> this morning ... Feel like we’re at a critical juncture.’ 
> 
> ‘He was appalled. **When I told him he kicked you**, he cried ... It was disgusting.
> And he knows it.’ 


Draw your own conclusion but these guys are *clearly* lying and aren't very good at it to boot. Well, maybe good enough to fool parts of the public, but not good enough to fool a judge.

The common law knows only two standards of proof: beyond reasonable doubt (or, as it is now put, so that the decision maker is sure) which applies in criminal cases and certain other immaterial situations and the balance of probabilities (which applies in civil cases) – see In re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)  [1996] AC 563, 586. The ‘balance of probabilities’ simply means, as Lord Nichols said in Re H, that, ‘a court is satisfied an event occurred if the court considers, on the evidence, the occurrence of the event was more likely than not.’

She has been accused of getting violent with partners of both sexes in the past, can’t be trusted, and unequivocally is a shitty person. 

But Johnny Depp is just as bad. Both of them need serious treatment for incredibly toxic anti social behavior. And the popularity of these posts reveals how many Reddit users are willing to forgive a man for his abuse, and crucify a woman for hers. 

The constant stanning of Depp as some avatar of male pain and oppression because his LifE iS RuiNed bY a MeAN WoMaN is pathetic. His life is not ruined, he has a zillion dollars and the best lawyers money can buy. Warner brothers still had to pay him his full salary after firing him from the Harry Potter Universe! Like 30 million dollars for ONE DAYS WORK! You think he’s in trouble? Get the fuck outta here. 

He is also an unstable manipulative narcissist and was neglectful and abusive to his (much younger) wife. He has a documented history of serious substance abuse, violence, entitlement, and erratic, irresponsible spending habits, which likely stem from some childhood abuse and undiagnosed conditions that he has been self medicating with sex, drugs and rock and roll for decades. 

Young gamer-gate-incels on the internet are hyping up this high profile example of mutual spousal abuse as a way of validating their misplaced rage towards women which stems from their own distorted self esteem.

Because to them, If a guy as handsome and rich as Depp isn’t safe from SCaRY woMEn who are going to FrAMe HiM aNd sTeaL hiS MoNEy, then what chance do they have of finding someone to love. It’s easier to paint all women as scheming bitches than it is to admit that the reason they are not attracted to you is YOU, not them. “Do I turn people off with my shitty personality and terrible social skills? No. It is the women who are wrong.”

Why do you even give a fuck about Johnny Depp’s livelihood? He hasn’t made a good film in years! His music is crappy and self indulgent. He has nothing interesting to say, and has done a lot of damage to perceptions Native American culture through his thoughtless marketing of his minuscule drop of native blood.

So, many people decide to believe both of them were abusive towards each other, because at the time, all the manipulated evidence Heard handed to the court seemed believable, but idk, as far as I've seen (and I've really been investigating like a gossipy bitch) Depp's proof seems more solid for the fact that it stands by itself and he isn't contradicting it all the time as Heard does, and even if he's been dialing with addiction there's no factual evidence to imply that Depp was at some point abusive towards one or all of his previous partners, he didn't hit them,at least, according to them, and since we weren't there we are left to assume they are telling the truth (which isn't the best thing to do from a legal point of view and because of that and if I remember correctly this isn't going to be taken as proof by the court anyway), now, Heard does have a record since a few years ago she was found being physically abusive towards her then girlfriend and a police officer had to arrest her, however, all charges were dropped since her partner didn't want to make a case against her, this is not going to be taken as evidence since the court felt it's not relevant for the present case of defamation against her (if i remember correctly). Another bunch of people decide to believe Depp was guilty because of the veredict on the case of defamation against The sun, but the veredict only states that since at the time all the evidence made Depp seem guilty, The sun had the right to make their claims that he was undoubtedly a ""wife beater"", they decided not to take into consideration all the new evidence Depp handed to the court because according to the judge, his evidence (and apparently only his, not hers) wasn't reliable in his eyes, and he also decided to call him a monster on his judgment which was completely out of place (in my opinion). So, that's a ""brief"" explanation from my point of view on the case, relying of course on all the evidence that I've seen, so take this as a personal opinion since no veredict has been made so far on the main trial and both of them still have the right to prove their innocence, and being simple spectators we must not forget the presumption of innocence exists for one reason.",t1_gf5tlzb,r/shittymoviedetails,Mr_BlurryFace_,2020-12-10 03:02:12+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

Depp's been in showbusiness for 40 years now.  His relative poverty is his own  fault.  He didn't lose Pirates because of Heard, he lost it because he fucking sucked in Dead Men.  That Potter movie (which he DID lose due to their stupid public fighting along with his Grindewald being a dud) was going to be his last blockbuster role anyway, and he only got it as a favor to Helena Bonham Carter.  If Depp could maybe stop blowing literally 60 grand on booze alone per month he'd be on easy street based on royalties.

Even Tim Burton doesn't want to work with him anymore and it's not because of Amber Heard, it's because Depp became a crappy actor and incredibly difficult to direct in addition to being sorta delusional.  He honestly claimed that he was fine to play Tonto because his Great Grandmother was probably half Indian.  That's some Steven Segal level of insanity there.

Here's my own addition to that...

He ain't starving.  He got 10 million for Minamata and another 4 to voice a bird in some dumbass kid's movie.

Heard is getting blockbuster roles because she puts asses in the seats.  Depp isn't because he's old and phones it in.  His time is done and this stupid legal spat is simply window dressing.  The way he moved in Dead Men is almost as pathetic as Harrison Ford in Episode 7.  If Heard weren't selling the box office out they'd put her to pasture over this same crap.

When all the legal bullshit is done with they're gonna go back to each other again.  Their codependency isn't going to be solved just because lawsuits were filed.

They're both trash people, one just has a lot more market value.

They'll be fucking again.  I leave you with a snippet from this choice phone conversation of theirs:

Depp: “I left last night. Honestly, I swear to you because I just couldn’t take the idea of more physicality, more physical abuse on each other. Because had we continued it, it would have gotten fucking bad. And baby, I told you this once. I’m scared to death we are a fucking crime scene right now.”

No, it went from innocence to ""what about her?!"". So spare me any notions of non-partisanship. 

Heard had the brains not to sue a rag for calling her abusive. Depp did, and he lost, and now he's got an official court ruling labeling him as abusive. *That's* why he's taking most of the heat. There is a big difference between accusing each other of being abusive, and a court ruling saying ""Yep, you're abusive"". People can't be so naive as to not understand this. 

And dear god, people are exaggerating so much with regards to his career being ""down the drain"" or ""dead"". He got let go from a movie a lot of fans felt he was miscast for to begin with. I wouldn't be surprised if the studio just took this as a convenient excuse to get rid of him. Dior still backs him, among others, and he's got another film set to release in 2021, and I would be positively shocked if Depp never starred in a movie after that because of this.

If you have not already, I strongly suggest you look into the judgement independently, the whole thing is available online.

It pretty much came down to the judge taking Ambers word in nearly every case, she said x happened, or one of her friends said x happened, and the judge accepted this is fact, often with no supporting evidence. the defence given for these judgements was essentially, ""why would she lie? she said this stuff under oath!""

In each case where Depp or one of his associates/ friends said that x occurred, the judge rejects the statements, saying that he cannot be trusted and his friends are on his payroll so will say anything to protect him.

There are also several parts where there is literally no evidence of something occurring, other than Ambers says it did and Jonny says it didnt, in every instance they are ruled in Ambers favour, explanation being that Jonny was probably on drugs and therefore cannot be trusted to tell the truth.

There is a detailed video by JCS criminal phycology that analyses Amber's deposition in quite some detail, I again suggest you watch this, its quite an eye opener and it really does seem like she is lying/ doesnt give a shit.

There are multiple instances where statements by Amber and her associates are proven to be false, and the judge rules that this was an honest mistake and should not indicate she is lying... it gets really silly, seriously, read it.

There was even an instance where a senior female police officer who specialises in domestic abuse, and even leads domestic abuse training classes, attended the scene of one of their fights. The officer said that Amber had no injuries at that time, although photo evidence taken the next day showed some scratches and bruises. Depp and Heard were separated between the officers attending and the time the photos were taken. Adding this together would indicate that Heard self harmed that night to be able to take the photos. In this instance the testimony of the police officer and her partner who was also in attendance was thrown out and discounted.

The list goes on.

Finally there are some slightly tin foil hat explanations going around stating that Ambers legal team had some strong ties to the judges wife, I cannot at all say if this is true, but could indicate a reason for the obvious bias if it is.

The point being that for a lot of (straight/white) men they have never been discriminated against before for something inherent to themselves. So it's difficult to empathise with other groups when they are speaking about discrimination they've faced. I'm trying to say, look at this story, it's awful, and look how it makes you feel. Now in this moment think about how black/gay/female people feel like when they face worse, more serious discrimination on a much more regular basis.

The allegations being true is The Sun’s allegations, and the only thing the Sun alleges is that Heard has made claims. They made no actual allegations against Depp of their own. So 12 out of 14 substantially true allegations, is just that they can prove that Heard did make at least 12 out of the 14 allegations that the paper said she did. Nothing more. The truthfulness of Heard’s statements can only be ruled on as a matter of law in a case that actually involves her directly, not just being called as a witness to testify that she has made certain allegations. And there is such a case filed, but it hasn’t been tested YET.",t1_gf6jc82,r/shittymoviedetails,EtherMan,2020-12-09 17:05:20+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

I do believe that we have a system for punishing people that commit domestic abuse and if demanding they lose their job was the route that should be taken then the court should have the right to fire you from your job. Some people may need to make sure they don't have any fellow employees that they need to get fired to ensure nobody that commits domestic violence ever has a job again lol. They make movies. They both treated each other like crap. If they need to be punished there is a legal system to do so. Considering neither has been charged and thrown in jail means neither was that concerned with what happened to them. They were both so hurt by what happened to them that neither felt the need to have the other arrested for their abuse. Hmm...maybe they don't care so you shouldn't either.

What you fail to understand is that personal accountability isn't the same as legal accountability. If Depp is found guilty of domestic abuse, then that's jail time. What's happened here is that WB is holding him personally accountable for blowing up the headlines with negative press about himself.  This shit was a *dead topic* years ago when the original allegations came out. But ***Depp chose*** to pursue a libel case ***and lost*** thus resurrecting the problematic allegations. This puts the studio in an untenable position where they have no choice to fire him.

The ""people calling for losing of jobs"" never happened. Heard and Depp's abuse issues happened years ago. They were basically a dead topic. The Sun published Heard's claims that Depp abused her, so Depp sued The Sun for libel as an attempt to get Heard in court, herself.

A judge not only found that 12 out of 14 of Heard's claims were substantiated as truthful, but also admonished  Depp for trying to use a libel case against a third party to make his ex-wife a witness in that same libel case.

It was losing the libel case that resulted in WB firing Depp because he basically kicked an otherwise dormant hornet's nest *and* a court now validated Heard's abuse claims as ""truthful enough to publish"" - paraphrasing mine.

I can’t as an example sue my wife and the judge go “well it’s not part of this case or anything but I’m just gonna put down in this ruling that u/nopethatswrong is actually a pedo”. You just can’t do that. I’m sorry but you just can’t. It simply does not work that way.

He sued them for libel yes, but all they said was that Heard said it. As such, all in question is if she said it or not. NOT if what she said was true.

The motte-and-bailey fallacy (named after the motte-and-bailey castle) is a form of argument and an informal fallacy where an arguer conflates two positions which share similarities, one modest and easy to defend (the ""motte"") and one much more controversial (the ""bailey""). The arguer advances the controversial position, but when challenged, they insist that they are only advancing the more modest position. Upon retreating to the motte, the arguer can claim that the bailey has not been refuted (because the critic refused to attack the motte) or that the critic is unreasonable (by equating an attack on the bailey with an attack on the motte).

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

A lot of the circumstances has Depp just walking away from the situation or as you said taking the abuse. I'm not saying Depp is innocent either but we live in a world where if a woman is abusing you you're expected to just deal with it or take it but the moment you defend yourself you're the abuser. Like what? But say a woman is being abused and she defends herself no one calls her an abuser she is called strong for standing up for herself. You see how hypocritical the whole situation is?

Not to mention that if Depp is a known abuser don't you think his former partners would've come out and buried the guy? As their way of finally getting justice for the abuse they endured? But no, that isn't what happened they all sang his praises. 

It's sad that if someone has a history of substance abuse they are seen as a bad person, that's literally the argument I see brought up when people try and say Depp was the bad person in all this.

Hello /u/Agentpferd.  you do not have enough karma to post. You need more than 2500**total karma** to post here. It

No, award karma doesn't count. We don't do P2W here.

Check your karma breakdown here:  http://old.reddit.com/u/Agentpferd/overview

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Todavía es más que ridículo cuánta gente se mantiene al margen y la apoya, incluyendo a casi todos los HSH, pero la reacción por hacerlo es masiva. Cualquier sección de comentarios a la que vayas está llena de apoyo a Depp y la mayoría de la gente, incluso identificando a las feministas, encuentra que lo que le está pasando es ridículo. Espero que su carrera sufra por esto, ya que Warner Bros recibe un golpe en su cuenta bancaria tanto para Aquaman 2 como para Fantastic Beasts 3. Rezo para que las ofertas para Depp empiecen a llegar y pueda seguir haciendo lo que mejor sabe hacer. Tristemente, Disney y otros estudios con los que tuvo su trabajo más icónico no es probable que lo vuelvan a contratar, pero ese es el tipo de daño que hacen las mujeres como Heard.

&#x200B;

No he visto a la gente apoyar a un hombre abusado como este en masa desde que la gente se enteró de lo que estaba pasando con Brendan Fraser. Cuando me enteré de lo que algunas de mis compañeras me habían hecho hace años, se burlaron de mí, me llamaron mentirosa, me dijeron que ""debería haberme defendido"" o que ""debería haber hecho algo para merecerlo"". Cosas que no se le dirían a una mujer en la misma situación sin una reacción extrema. Me dijeron que guardara silencio al respecto para ""no desviar la atención de las víctimas femeninas"" y que lo que me pasó ""no era gran cosa porque le pasa más a las mujeres"". Me dijeron todo esto en línea (incluyendo este sitio), y ni siquiera pude obtener ayuda en persona. Después de decirle a dos terapeutas distintos que una mujer me sostenía a punta de cuchillo y me obligaba a tener relaciones sexuales con ella, su primera pregunta para mí fue ""¿Qué crees que hiciste para provocarla?""

&#x200B;

Es por eso que la mayoría de las víctimas masculinas se mantienen calladas. Esta era una actitud común hacia nosotros hace sólo unos años. Ahora la gente finalmente responsabiliza a una mujer por abusar de un hombre y se siente bien ver todos sus comentarios.",t1_ger89ri,r/padresconderecho,rodrigohernandez4477,2020-12-06 13:46:53+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

*I'm glad that abused men are finally being taken seriously after the Johnny Depp x Amber Heard fiasco.*

It's still beyond ridiculous how many people stand by and support her, including pretty much all MSM, but the backlash for doing so is massive. Any comment section you go to is full of support for Depp and the majority of people, even identifying feminists, find what's happening to him to be ridiculous. I hope her career suffers from this as Warner Bros gets hit right in their bank account for both Aquaman 2 and Fantastic Beasts 3. I pray offers for Depp start to flood in and he can keep doing what he does best. Sadly Disney and other studios he had his most iconic work with aren't likely to hire him back, but that's the kind of damage women like Heard do.


I haven't seen people come out in support of an abused man like this en masse since people found out what was happening to Brendan Fraser. When I came out about what a few of my female partners have done to me years ago I was mocked, called a liar, told I ""should have defended myself"", or that I ""must have done something to deserve it"". Things that wouldn't be said to a woman in the same situation without extreme backlash. I was told to keep quiet about it as to ""not take attention away from female victims"" and that what happened to me ""wasn't a big deal because it happens to women more"". I was told all of this online (including this site), and couldn't even get help in person. After telling two separate therapists that a woman held me at knife point and forced me to have sex with her, their first question to me was ""What do you think YOU did to PROVOKE HER?""


This is why most male victims keep quiet. This was a common attitude towards us only a few years ago. Now people are finally holding a woman accountable for abusing a man and it feels good seeing all their comments.

You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

#Please do not message us about this, we need the minimum karma filter to prevent spam. Thank you

Todavía es más que ridículo cuánta gente se mantiene al margen y la apoya, incluyendo a casi todos los HSH, pero la reacción por hacerlo es masiva. Cualquier sección de comentarios a la que vayas está llena de apoyo a Depp y la mayoría de la gente, incluso identificando a las feministas, encuentra que lo que le está pasando es ridículo. Espero que su carrera sufra por esto, ya que Warner Bros recibe un golpe en su cuenta bancaria tanto para Aquaman 2 como para Fantastic Beasts 3. Rezo para que las ofertas para Depp empiecen a llegar y pueda seguir haciendo lo que mejor sabe hacer. Tristemente, Disney y otros estudios con los que tuvo su trabajo más icónico no es probable que lo vuelvan a contratar, pero ese es el tipo de daño que hacen las mujeres como Heard.

&#x200B;

No he visto a la gente apoyar a un hombre abusado como este en masa desde que la gente se enteró de lo que estaba pasando con Brendan Fraser. Cuando me enteré de lo que algunas de mis compañeras me habían hecho hace años, se burlaron de mí, me llamaron mentirosa, me dijeron que ""debería haberme defendido"" o que ""debería haber hecho algo para merecerlo"". Cosas que no se le dirían a una mujer en la misma situación sin una reacción extrema. Me dijeron que guardara silencio al respecto para ""no desviar la atención de las víctimas femeninas"" y que lo que me pasó ""no era gran cosa porque le pasa más a las mujeres"". Me dijeron todo esto en línea (incluyendo este sitio), y ni siquiera pude obtener ayuda en persona. Después de decirle a dos terapeutas distintos que una mujer me sostenía a punta de cuchillo y me obligaba a tener relaciones sexuales con ella, su primera pregunta para mí fue ""¿Qué crees que hiciste para provocarla?""

&#x200B;

Es por eso que la mayoría de las víctimas masculinas se mantienen calladas. Esta era una actitud común hacia nosotros hace sólo unos años. Ahora la gente finalmente responsabiliza a una mujer por abusar de un hombre y se siente bien ver todos sus comentarios.",t1_geqi6df,r/PadresConDerechos,rodrigohernandez4477,2020-12-06 13:47:06+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

No, award karma doesn't count. We don't do P2W here.

Hello /u/that-emo-child.  you do not have enough karma to post. You need more than 2500**total karma** to post here. It

No, award karma doesn't count. We don't do P2W here.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Feminists love to solve problems via definitions.

* Sexism against men: Solved by defining sexism as something that only happens to women.

* Racism against white people: Solved by defining racism  as something that cannot happen to white people.

* Women commiting rape: Solved by defining rape as only something men can do.

For example the latest NISVS State Report shows that in the previous 12 months: 

- 1.2% of women have been raped

- 0.2% of men have been raped (penetrated)

- 1.5% of men have been forced to have sex against their will (not rape: Thanks feminist academics led by Mary P Koss)

- 1.175% of men were forced to have sex against their will **by women**.

* Feminists discriminating against men: Define a feminist as someone for equality. 

Feminists sure do love to solve problems using definitions...

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules
>
>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

It doesn't matter if she isn't political because she 'makes pp hard'. There's also enough incriminating evidence against her pointing out she was abusive (if not outright criminal, one does not simply get away with chopping off his finger), or to fit to the thing about 'both being in a toxic relationship' (citing his drug problems and a text message to Paul Bettany venting out his apparent drug fuelled frustrations as evidence that Depp's no saint), not to mention past domestic violence cases against her ex-girlfriends. The only reason Depp lost the case was because he was in a defamatiom case against an already controversial tabloid in The Sun, who just had to prove that they are justified in calling him a 'wife-beater' on technical terms, not Heard herself. Not to mention the judge dismissed the actual audio tapes where Heard basically confirmed as being the main perpetrator of violence, citing 'not said under oath'. Depp has multiple eye-witnesses and evidence, Heard at most had just testimony from her sister and a select few of her friends. It doesn't matter if some shady morons like Le Quarterpounder is covering it with ulterior motives, that doesn't mean Amber gets a free pass just because some 'misogynist, right wing YouTube channels' are also covering the case. Male domestic violence and false allegations have been an equally serious issue as much as actual domestic violence and harrasment, just not given much attention (In India, where I live, there's no law incriminating females for sexual harrasment, whereas she can get away with jailing the entire family over a false allegation of dowry/domestic violence/sexual harrasment etc, and when proven false in court she gets away scot free or just a slap on her wrist).

This, combined with my belief that no woman should feel muzzled if she earnestly feels she's been wronged, leads me to the conclusion that the whole thing is too complex for me to hold any kind of balanced, informed opinion on the matter. I'm left hoping and praying that the legal experts involved make the right decisions, and that both Johnny and Amber can get some kind of objective, ethical resolution, allowing them to move on with their lives.

I feel the actors will be fine, Warner Bros is really who would hurt if all 1.6 million of us don’t watch their stuff. They are the ones pouring money into these movies, the actors their time. They have set amounts to pay them in case of it being a flop. They also have every day to contemplate their roles in the movie and consider the option of joining those against Heard and decide to boycott as well.

Karma is a human concept. There's no karma. Good things can happen to bad people. Bad things happen to good people. Actually, now that I thought about it -- good and bad is a human concept also. Hence why in nature animals technically do 'rape' other animals and they viciously murder and kill other animals for their flesh and eat their young babies while squirming and struggling to live. It would be super disturbing to see humans functioning without all their constructs and 'rules' for being a human.

The only reason why most bad things happen to bad people because we developed the social construct of punishing people for doing bad things. You steal something? You get chained up and thrown in a cell. Simple.

Todavía es más que ridículo cuánta gente se mantiene al margen y la apoya, incluyendo a casi todos los HSH, pero la reacción por hacerlo es masiva. Cualquier sección de comentarios a la que vayas está llena de apoyo a Depp y la mayoría de la gente, incluso identificando a las feministas, encuentra que lo que le está pasando es ridículo. Espero que su carrera sufra por esto, ya que Warner Bros recibe un golpe en su cuenta bancaria tanto para Aquaman 2 como para Fantastic Beasts 3. Rezo para que las ofertas para Depp empiecen a llegar y pueda seguir haciendo lo que mejor sabe hacer. Tristemente, Disney y otros estudios con los que tuvo su trabajo más icónico no es probable que lo vuelvan a contratar, pero ese es el tipo de daño que hacen las mujeres como Heard.

No he visto a la gente apoyar a un hombre abusado como este en masa desde que la gente se enteró de lo que estaba pasando con Brendan Fraser. Cuando me enteré de lo que algunas de mis compañeras me habían hecho hace años, se burlaron de mí, me llamaron mentirosa, me dijeron que ""debería haberme defendido"" o que ""debería haber hecho algo para merecerlo"". Cosas que no se le dirían a una mujer en la misma situación sin una reacción extrema. Me dijeron que guardara silencio al respecto para ""no desviar la atención de las víctimas femeninas"" y que lo que me pasó ""no era gran cosa porque le pasa más a las mujeres"". Me dijeron todo esto en línea (incluyendo este sitio), y ni siquiera pude obtener ayuda en persona. Después de decirle a dos terapeutas distintos que una mujer me sostenía a punta de cuchillo y me obligaba a tener relaciones sexuales con ella, su primera pregunta para mí fue ""¿Qué crees que hiciste para provocarla?""

Es por eso que la mayoría de las víctimas masculinas se mantienen calladas. Esta era una actitud común hacia nosotros hace sólo unos años. Ahora la gente finalmente responsabiliza a una mujer por abusar de un hombre y se siente bien ver todos sus comentarios.",t3_k2lwh5,r/masculinismo,rodrigohernandez4477,2020-12-06 13:58:28+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral

Domestic abuse is against the law, but even with the hard proof Depp had, Heard walked away. So in saying that, if a actor was accused of being a pedophile, and there was substantial evidence to prove it so, but was allowed to walk away, would you not be a tad annoyed? Or would you become a “cancel culture” member? 

>there’s a million other pedophiles in this world

Just because there’s a million other abusers or pedophiles, doesn’t mean we should just let the ones who’ve been favoured by society walk away. Heard deserves to be faced with consequences for what she did, whatever that may be it needs to happen.

In April 2019, Johnny Depp had filed his $50 million lawsuit against her for defamation. 

The statement from Depp’s lawyer Adam Waldman in April 2019, “A hoax confronted with the reality of evidence requires new lies to sustain itself. Yesterday’s filing, made by a woman with a prior arrest and incarceration for domestic abuse, presented Amber Heard’s new lies. Which part of 87 surveillance videos, 19 (and growing) sworn eyewitness statements, audio tapes, time and date stamped photographs, police depositions and her own sworn testimony does Amber Heard and her PR team think the public is too stupid to comprehend?”
He also added, “We are now interviewing other women who have come forward claiming they are victims of horrific acts of violence and other abuse at the hands of Amber Heard, in addition to Johnny Depp and Tasya van Ree, the latter of whom Ms. Heard was previously arrested and incarcerated for assaulting.”

Amber Heard was then cast in the Stand in August 2019 and started filming in September. 
April is before August if I’m not mistaken. 

Then in January 2020, the videos of Amber Heard gaslighting, manipulating and admitting she was physically abusive to Depp emerged. 
Filming of the Stand finished in March 2020, they could have fired her and reshot. 

As I said she had already been arrested and incarcerated after assaulting a previous partner in 2009 and this was public knowledge. 

They knew what she was, still chose to hire her and to continue hiring, so fuck her, and fuck anyone who chose to work along side her.

Did you know, the police in our country originate from slave patrols? Again, read about the prison industrial complex and its history, as well as how the 13th amendment is worded in a way that allowed it to happen.

Also, no matter how much additional training they get, how many seminars or counseling sessions are given on police brutality, how much additional money they get, the police are going to brutalize people. That’s their job. They go in to force someone to live in a place designed to punish, and if they resist, they must forcibly arrest them. You can’t honestly expect that even with those measures, not a single cop is going to continue to be an abuser of power. 

Also you misunderstand the culture. Not every cop is genuinely a bad person, but police academy teaches you that every civilian you meet could be someone you have to be prepared to arrest, tackle, or shoot. Police are loyal to each other to a fault. Calling another cop out for wrong doing or be any sort of whistleblower is highly looked down upon, and that sentiment exists in every level of the hierarchy. Cops who do are usually fired and can end up getting killed. Good cops don’t exist because truly good cops, the ones who stay quiet, don’t last. No matter how much training you give them, how much you raise their salaries by, poorer communities (the areas that are most commonly over policed) have nothing but misery to gain from the continued existence of police. They need to be abolished.

Anyways, look at the city budgets for police departments compared to any other social program. The budget is often billions higher than even the fire departments. Imagine how many people’s lives would improve if we used the money the police use for better equipment and better riot gear to instead fund social programs, like education for instance. If instead of consolidating power to a single group, we have individuals in communities work together to look out for the entire community- this could also be funded with the abundant amounts of money the police are given.
Detectives should still be a thing, but they shouldn’t be able to physically confront suspects.

also... wtf do you mean amber isn’t relevant in this discussion???? johnny’s sued the sun for libel because they said he’s a wife beater, meaning his only defence was to try and prove that amber heard’s allegations were false. the case against the sun was LITERALLY johnny v amber. again, read the documents. the entire case boils down to who’s claims the judge believed the most, johnny’s or amber’s. she is very much part of the discussion. and yeah, i’m well aware their relationship was unhealthy or toxic or whatever on both sides, but i DO NOT believe that johnny was physically abusive or deserving of the label “wife beater”

the youtube videos are relevant because they cover the evidence on both sides. the titles are very biased because they’re meant to grab people’s attention, that’s how youtube works.

this is ofc relevant to the sun case because it shows pretty damn clearly that amber’s recounting of the events is less than truthful. at the very least, when you see all of it laid out the way it is in the videos, it’s enough to cast a lot of doubt on amber’s allegations, which are at the very core of the sun case. it’s hard to see how a judge could rule that amber’s story was believable enough to justify the sun’s article, and how he could dismiss pretty much all the evidence against her as being largely irrelevant to the case. those youtube videos are a great way to gain a pretty decent understanding of the conflict between johnny and amber, which is necessary to understand and form an opinion on johnny’s case against the sun",t1_gfrabm6,r/shittymoviedetails,resveries,2020-12-14 00:56:41+00:00,[],Negative,Neutral

As for the original post.... her costars should care as should WB, especially considering he was set for his role in the HP film and when his lawyer petitioned to adjust the date for his case against amber in the states due to the filming schedule amber contacted WB personally which is outlined in court documents. Even before that their personal life effected his career and his charitable acts he lost his pirates role and he can’t even visit the children hospital that she lied about donating their divorce settlement to in costume as jack sparrow anymore.  

So yes, business is business but their personal life and her baseless accusations effected his career with nothing to back it up just her word.... which was her goal and clearly still is when she contacted WB.... why shouldn’t it effect hers??? Especially when it’s again her words, in addition to those of countless others including those closest to her, and everything she’s claimed has been proven to be a lie down to her stealing an assistants rape/DV story.....  then after Johnny gets dropped by WB she posts about how excited she is to start filming AM2 when a date hasn’t even been set to start filming almost as if she’s bragging they sided with her over him. 


This shows and goes over the court documents and Johnny being confirmed for the Harry Potter film he was just dropped from, request for changing the start date for the case against AH that hasn’t started yet in the states due to filming schedules for the Harry Potter film, and her contacting WB directly..... https://youtu.be/mUclMrpr6UU",t1_gebko9i,r/DCEUleaks,Swat4584,2020-12-16 10:31:04+00:00,[{'display_url': 'https://youtu.be'}],Positive,Negative

When your voice feels little (and outnumbered) that is when it has the most impact. Conversely, when you are saying things that lots of people are already saying and spreading awareness of, you are not helping as much.

Do you have that same attitude when it comes to speaking out against other injustices?

With all my love and respect I say:

These sound like excuses and you actually just don't care about this issue as much as other (more traditional feminist) issues. One can't help but wonder \*why\* this issue (which seriously damages lives) is not important. Some people would just assume that it's because you care more about women and their issues than you care about men and their issues. If that is the case, I wouldn't blame you! it is only natural to care more for the group that you identify with more! But also I feel like you probably want to do better than that natural behavior, and instead care for people equally regardless of gender, race, cultural identity, etc.. That is the ideal, isn't it? :)",t1_gekhsdz,r/AskFeministWomen,zenflow87,2020-12-04 16:13:53+00:00,[],Positive,Neutral
