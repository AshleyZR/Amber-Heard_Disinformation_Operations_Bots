amber heard has experienced her share of hardships in 2016, and while she finalizes her divorce from johnny depp, it seems she’s doing her best to heal… and help others in the process. 

amber wrote an open letter in porter magazine, addressing domestic abuse. although the actress has since dropped charges, she has accused depp of physically and verbally abusing her throughout their relationship. 

amber writes, “you are not alone. you may have suffered alone behind closed doors, but you are not alone… you need to know that. i want to remind you of your strength, a strength that has been multiplied by the number of women who stand silently behind you – a truth hat allowed me to break down the doors i once found myself behind.” 

amber has reportedly signed a divorce agreement that bounds her by confidentiality, but her fans can certainly read between the lines. 

she says she once “resented the label of ‘victim,’” but is now hoping that she can help other women seek help and be safe if they need it.

'justice league': first look at amber heard as mera, queen of atlantis

variety first reported in january that heard the cast as the love interest of momoa joined aquaman. the film also stars j. k. simmons as commissioner gordon, while amy adams, jeremy irons, and jesse eisenberg reprise their roles as lois lane, alfred pennyworth, and lex luthor, respectively. earlier this month, he announced snyder behind the scenes footage, october 7, coinciding with the last day of filming in the uk

in a recent interview with the variety, gadot addressed sexuality wonder woman comics after writer greg rucka said that ""obviously"" had relationships with other women.

gadot said his sexuality in the upcoming film ""wonder woman"" is ""something we have not explored.""

""in this movie, she does not experience any bisexual relations,"" he said. ""but it's not about that. she is a woman who loves people for what they are. she can be bisexual. she loves people by their hearts.""

warner bros. will release ""justice league"" on 17 november 2017 with a sequel yet-to-be-titled expected to be released on june 14, 2019. ""wonder woman"" opens june 2.

justice league - first look at amber heard as mera:

it's all or nothing at this point to warner bros. and dc comics universe with its cinematic superheroes. it's not as if his films have not been a financial success so far, but have taken a forthright criticism of the box office thanks to rampant interference study and a clear direction. justice league, on the other hand, is trying to change all that. great movie team up zack snyder will offer all kinds of heroes, the brutal billionaires who are confused by the tsunami crushers owls titanc depths.
and some secondary characters added to the mix as well. ign revealed the first look at aquaman's greatest ally, as amber heard donned the uniform of a royal armor for smackdown.

and this is a concept art design by ian joyner io9 through.

damn, that looks absolutely fantastic. say what you like about snyder, but production usually involves some absolutely fantastic costume design. in the dc comics material source, mera becomes aquaman's wife and queen of atlantis. she is also a formidable, able to match blows with foes heavyweight thanks to its unique biology that allows him to survive the crushing pressure of the deep ocean fighter.

but it's his skill with hydrokinesis really makes him dangerous. mera can increase the density of water around, essentially, tightening and remodeling in various forms of effective combat which can crush enemies. it is basically a master water below. anyway, that's a first look fantastic on queen atlante, although do not expect her to have too much of a role to play in the league of justice.

mera amber heard will, however, be much more prominent in the film by james wan aquaman, which begins filming next year. as for the justice league, which is currently still on track for a launch in november 2017. and hopefully not blow your load before then reveal with too much hype this time. there is nothing wrong with keeping a few of revealing the secret, ya dig?

in her court filings, she claimed that last saturday depp hit her with a cell phone, pulled her hair and screamed at her. she also alleged that he was abusive throughout their entire 15-month marriage which is why she bailed. all of us who judged amber as a mega, gold-digging bitch with a heart made of ice for dumping johnny a couple of days after his mom died sure look like assholes now, hey? in her court filing, amber says that johnny was verbally and physically aggressive towards her during their entire message, but i guess him going all naomi campbell on her by chucking a cell phone at her face was the last straw. she went and filed the police report after that and they took pics of her cell phone beaten face. here’s the thing about a lot of these major hunks from the 90s: sometimes they turn out to really fucking suck. i mean, amber and i are the same age, born in 1986, and she probably grew up thinking he was really talented and hot like so many people in the 80s and 90s did,. then she grows up, he proposes, and she scores her childhood crush. too bad he turns out to be a dog smuggling, anti-oral hygiene, pirate wannabe who throws cell phones at her fucking face like he’s latoya fucking jackson. and look at katie holmes! she grew up in the 80s and 90s probably thinking tom cruise was the shit and figured she was mega #blessed when they started dating. but instead of fulfilling her pubescent fantasies with the dude from “risky business”, she got sucked into the cult of scientology for several years and had to make that god awful “mad money” movie with queen latifah! if it weren’t for brad pitt, i’d assume all the major heart throbs of my youth were weird pieces of shit.

even though the title of this blog was technically click bait that i stole from my friend simone’s sister-in-law (or cousin-in-law, i forget), i do hope amber will go back to dating hot ladies rather than abusive douche bag has-beens. i think she’d be much better off with a ruby rose rather than a mel gibson.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/udYEVK3w2CM/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/udYEVK3w2CM/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/udYEVK3w2CM/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/udYEVK3w2CM/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/udYEVK3w2CM/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Ashfaq Rana,"['Johnny', 'Depp', 'Vanessa', 'Paradis', 'Amber Heard', 'money', 'abuse', 'allegations', 'breaks', 'silence', 'assaulting', 'the', 'pirates', 'of', 'carribean', 'hollywood', 'gossip', 'divorce', 'bisexuality', 'pained', 'blackmailing', 'fun vids channel', 'politics', 'hero', 'heroin', 'news', 'latest', 'lesbian', 'homo', 'ban']",25,none,Amber Heard Should Have Stayed THE SAME | Johnny Depp,"The other day, my friend Simone posted a link on my Facebook wall about how Amber Heard filed for divorce from Johnny Depp mere days after his mother died.

a black girl from kentucky was humiliated by jail officials when she was brought into a courtroom without pants, leaving a louisville judge in disbelief.

“am i in the twilight zone right now?” judge amber wolf asked on courtroom video friday afternoon. 

the female defendant in the video was in jail for failing to complete a diversion program for a prior shoplifting charge. during her time at metro corrections in louisville she said she was never given a uniform and was forced to spend her time there without pants or feminine hygiene products.

wolf immediately began making phone calls to metro corrections officials in the video, outraged over the treatment of the woman.

“i’m not trying to embarrass you, i’m very sorry,” wolf told the defendant in court. “can we get her something to cover up with? anything, anything, anything. i don’t care what it is.”

steve durham, a spokesman for the jail, told local station wdrb that the woman had not been in custody long enough to receive a jail jumpsuit. she had been in the jail for three days prior to her court appearance.

A black girl from Kentucky was humiliated by jail officials when she was brought into a courtroom without pants, leaving a Louisville judge in disbelief.

“Am I in the Twilight Zone right now?” Judge Amber Wolf asked on courtroom video Friday afternoon. 

The female defendant in the video was in jail for failing to complete a diversion program for a prior shoplifting charge. During her time at Metro Corrections in Louisville she said she was never given a uniform and was forced to spend her time there without pants or feminine hygiene products.

Wolf immediately began making phone calls to Metro Corrections officials in the video, outraged over the treatment of the woman.

“I’m not trying to embarrass you, I’m very sorry,” Wolf told the defendant in court. “Can we get her something to cover up with? Anything, anything, anything. I don’t care what it is.”

Steve Durham, a spokesman for the jail, told local station WDRB that the woman had not been in custody long enough to receive a jail jumpsuit. She had been in the jail for three days prior to her court appearance.

“What the hell is going on?” Wolf can be heard saying on the phone. “I am holding her here until she is dressed appropriately to go back to jail. This is outrageous.”

“This is her only charge ever,” Wolf added. “She should have been in jail for maybe a day, tops.”

the adderall diaries official trailer #1 (2016) - james franco, amber heard movie hd

as a writer stymied by past success, writers block, substance abuse, relationship problems and a serious set of father issues, elliott's cracked-out chronicle of a bizarre murder trial amounts to less than the sum of its parts. not long into the 2007 trial of programmer hans reiser, accused of murdering his wife, the defendant's friend sean sturgeon obliquely confessed to several murders (though not the murder of reiser's wife). elliott, caught up in the film-ready twist and his tenuous connection to sturgeon (they share a bdsm social circle), makes a gonzo record of the proceedings. the result is a scattered, self-indulgent romp through the mind of a depressive narcissist obsessed with his insecurities and childhood traumas.

the divorce of amber heard and johnny depp is now final, and one thing’s for sure: heard didn’t get any money out of it.

she settled the divorce out of court for $7 million, all of which she has now donated to charitable causes. she’s splitting the sum between the american civil liberties union’s efforts to battle violence against women and the children’s hospital of los angeles, where she’s volunteered for the past 10 years.

and in a joint statement, both heard and depp affirmed that “neither party has made false accusations for financial gain.”

in other words: heard is not a gold digger, and she did not accuse depp of cutting off part of his finger and then using the stump to finger paint the words “easy amber” on a mirror because she thought that would be a cool quick way to make some cash.

it’s a shame heard felt the need to be so emphatic about the fact that she isn’t lying about her domestic violence claims, but it’s not surprising. ever since she first filed for a restraining order against depp in may, heard has done everything we say domestic abuse survivors should do. she went to the police. she provided copious documentation. she went above and beyond to prove she wasn’t in it for the money.

people still insisted she was lying.
the history of heard’s domestic violence allegations spans at least two years

on may 21, heard says she asked a friend to call the police after depp hit her with an iphone and struck her. when they arrived, hear told them she and depp had only been arguing — which she now says was an attempt to protect depp’s career. (it’s extremely common for victims of domestic abuse to feel the need to protect their abusers.)

lo que si hemos podido ver ha sido unas marcas en los brazos de amber que dan mucho qué pensar. ¿se trata de más pruebas para demostrar el presunto maltrato de depp?
¿es posible que sean resultado del duro trabajo de la actriz durante los días que estuvo en londres?
lo cierto es que el equipo legal de heard ha indicado que están buscando un acuerdo con johnny tan pronto como sea posible.

appearing on the howard stern show on monday (20jun16), the 49-year-old said he put his thoughts down in a post on his website six days after depp and heard officially split last month (may16).

he told stern, ""the title was 'at a loss for words...' thewrap got it as an exclusive, however that worked, and said, 'amber heard is blackmailing johnny depp - this is how i know'. i didn't write that f**king title. i didn't put that stupid tabloid title in there. i'm a better writer than that, so i don't know if it's hinged on that, i don't know how much of it is spite.""

heard has called the piece ""highly defamatory"", but stanhope insists his pal depp was happy with it: ""i had no contact with him (depp) until he texted me after that went out and said, 'hey, thanks for being honest'. he didn't know that was going out. i was a little petrified because it kind of made him look like a b**ch.""

and stanhope isn't taking amber's legal attack too seriously, smiling, ""the idea of some hollywood supermodel lady winning all of my s**t... she would be locking the doors driving down my street even without seeing a person. i live on the mexican border in this dirty pothole-riddled neighbourhood.""

the comic reveals his pal depp gave him a heads up about the split and suggested amber might accuse the actor of abusing her when the two friends spent time together on 21 may (16).

stanhope told stern, ""he was alluding to the fact that she was going to do something like this. she didn't come out until a week later that that happened. but it happened that night, and he was alluding to she's going to do something like this.

""i think what she's trying to do is make me shut the f**k up, because i can't say anything about it, and now i'm talking more.""

heard, 30, filed her defamation lawsuit against stanhope on 3 june (16). her lawyers accused him of trying to ""divert public attention away from the true facts regarding depp which caused their marriage to fail, namely, that depp repeatedly abused heard throughout their marriage, at times to the point of her fearing for her life.""

amber heard arrived at a scheduled deposition at 10:00 on saturday in los angeles, as part of an ongoing and increasingly messy divorce with johnny depp.

amber, aged 30, has accused johnny depp of domestic violence, and filed for divorce from the actor on may 25, two days later, she filed a domestic violence restraining order against depp.

the actress flew into los angeles on friday night after telling the judge that she couldn’t make the deposition scheduled for earlier that day due to an “emergency” that prevented her from catching her flight on time.

a week ago she showed up for a deposition, but according to tmz, refused to enter the conference room where lawyers and videographer were present.

the actress allegedly cried and screamed, and refused to submit to questioning.

amber heard did what abuse victims are “supposed” to do. people still didn’t believe her.

“as the result of amber’s decision to decline giving an initial statement to the lapd, her silence has been used against her by johnny’s team. amber did not provide a statement to the lapd in an attempt to protect her privacy and johnny’s career. johnny’s team has forced amber to give a statement to the lapd to set the record straight as to the true facts, as she cannot continue to leave herself open to the vicious false and malicious allegations that have infected the media. amber has suffered through years of physical and psychological abuse at the hands of johnny,” the statement, provided to just jared, began.

“in domestic violence cases, it is not unusual for the perpetrator’s playbook to include miscasting the victim as the villain,” the statement continued. “in reality, amber acted no differently than many victims of domestic violence, who think first of the harm that might come to the abuser, rather than the abuse they have already suffered. amber can no longer endure the relentless attacks and outright lies launched against her character in the court of public opinion since the tragic events of may 21st. with her statement amber hopes to give the lapd the opportunity to conduct an accurate and complete investigation into the events of that evening and before. if that occurs, and the truth is revealed, there is no doubt that amber’s claims will be substantiated beyond any doubt, and hopefully johnny will get the help that he so desperately needs.”

from the beginning it has been amber’s desire to keep this matter as private as possible, even though lapd officers responded to a 911 call made by a third-party. the lapd officers viewed not only the disarray that johnny had caused in the apartment but also the physical injuries to amber’s face. we filed the petition for dissolution of marriage at the very end of the day on monday may 23rd and we did not serve johnny with the petition at the premiere of alice through the looking glass that evening. we sent a letter to johnny’s counsel team the next morning making it clear we wanted to keep this matter out of the media. we then held off requesting a domestic violence restraining order as we knew that johnny was out of the country.

we took the high road. unfortunately, johnny’s team immediately went to the press and began viciously attacking amber’s character. amber is simply a victim of domestic violence, and none of her actions are motivated by money. amber is a brave and financially independent woman who is showing the courage of her convictions by doing the right thing against johnny’s relentless army of lawyers and surrogates.

dc fans, we’ve got your first look at justice league’s amber heard as mera, queen of atlantis
get ready to meet the misses and now, check out amber heard in all her atlantian glory on the set of justice league
we are still just over a year away from the release of dc’s justice league movie, and now we’re getting our first look at amber heard as the atlantian queen. ign exclusively released not only the final justice league concept art for mera’s costume, but also an incredible look at heard in full costume as mera, taken by the one and only, zack snyder, himself. snyder is directing the dc film, which is slated for november 17, 2017. 
while we can expect that heard’s role probably won’t be too major in justice league, we can hopefully expect a whole lot of mera in dc’s aquaman movie, to be direted by james wan, and currently scheduled for release in 2018, but it will be nice to see the chemistry between mera and aquaman and the rest of the justice league. 
along with justice league, next year, dc will also release wonder woman, so we’re in for an incredible slate of movies over the next few years. i can’t wait to see what dc brings to the table, but i want to know if this first look at mera has you even more pumped for justice league and aquaman, so leave your thoughts in the comments below. then, click right here to get some brand new details from the upcoming wolverine 3 movie. thanks so much for checking in with me here on clevver movies, i’m sinead de vries, and i’ll see you guys back here soon with more movie news.

the divorce of amber heard and johnny depp is now final, and one thing’s for sure: heard didn’t get any money out of it.

she settled the divorce out of court for $7 million, all of which she has now donated to charitable causes. she’s splitting the sum between the american civil liberties union’s efforts to battle violence against women and the children’s hospital of los angeles, where she’s volunteered for the past 10 years.

and in a joint statement, both heard and depp affirmed that “neither party has made false accusations for financial gain.”

in other words: heard is not a gold digger, and she did not accuse depp of cutting off part of his finger and then using the stump to finger paint the words “easy amber” on a mirror because she thought that would be a cool quick way to make some cash.

it’s a shame heard felt the need to be so emphatic about the fact that she isn’t lying about her domestic violence claims, but it’s not surprising. ever since she first filed for a restraining order against depp in may, heard has done everything we say domestic abuse survivors should do. she went to the police. she provided copious documentation. she went above and beyond to prove she wasn’t in it for the money.
people still insisted she was lying.

after months of fighting, amber heard and johnny depp suddenly settled their divorce this week, with heard donating all of the settlement money to charity.

their relationship was a tabloid magazine’s dream: hollywood a-lister falls in love with up-and-coming ingenue on set. later, as allegations of abuse emerged, coverage of their relationship took a noticeably darker turn, with lurid reports — and later video and photos — of violent outbursts and alleged physical abuse.

""a new video emerged the day before amber heard was due to be deposed in her ongoing legal battle with estranged husband, johnny depp, of an alleged altercation between the two. 

in the video that tmz first published friday, depp appears to be in a fit of rage over an unknown incident that occurred earlier in the day. he storms through the kitchen slamming cabinets, breaking objects and yelling expletives, all while interrogating heard. 

“nothing happened this morning, you know that?” she tells him. “i just woke up and you were so sweet and nice – we were not even fighting this morning. all i said was sorry.”

he then approaches heard, who reportedly filmed the video that sources in depp’s camp reportedly claim is “heavily edited,” to pour himself a large glass of wine. 

“you want to see crazy? i’ll give you crazy,” he says. “here’s me – all your crazy.”

Sam, Brett, Grace, and Jason Carter discuss the video. Let us know what you think of the video.

""A new video emerged the day before Amber Heard was due to be deposed in her ongoing legal battle with estranged husband, Johnny Depp, of an alleged altercation between the two. 

In the video that TMZ first published Friday, Depp appears to be in a fit of rage over an unknown incident that occurred earlier in the day. He storms through the kitchen slamming cabinets, breaking objects and yelling expletives, all while interrogating Heard. 

“Nothing happened this morning, you know that?” she tells him. “I just woke up and you were so sweet and nice – we were not even fighting this morning. All I said was sorry.”

He then approaches Heard, who reportedly filmed the video that sources in Depp’s camp reportedly claim is “heavily edited,” to pour himself a large glass of wine. 

“You want to see crazy? I’ll give you crazy,” he says. “Here’s me – all your crazy.”

heard, 30, said in a statement that she is dividing the full settlement equally between the american civil liberties union, specifically to prevent violence against women, and the children’s hospital of los angeles.

“as described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that i could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully help those less able to defend themselves,” the actress said.

depp’s representative did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

heard and depp, 53, privately settled their acrimonious divorce case on tuesday, a day ahead of a court hearing on the status of a restraining order the actress had obtained against her estranged husband.

the couple released a joint statement calling their relationship “intensely passionate and at times volatile but always bound by love,” adding that “there was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.”

the settlement ended the couple’s 15-month marriage after weeks of highly publicized claims of domestic violence by heard and counterclaims of financial blackmailing by depp.

depp, one of hollywood’s top actors and box-office draws with franchises such as “pirates of the caribbean,” married heard, known for “friday night lights,” in february 2015 after meeting on the set of the 2011 film “the rum diary.”

Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn ˈmʌsk/; born June 28, 1971) is a South African-born Canadian-American business magnate, investor[10][11] engineer[12] and inventor.[13][14][15][16]

He is the founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX; co-founder, CEO and product architect of Tesla Motors; co-founder and chairman of SolarCity, co-chairman of OpenAI; co-founder of Zip2; and founder of X.com which merged with PayPal of Confinity.[17][18][19] As of June 2016, he has an estimated net worth of US$12.7 billion, making him the 83rd wealthiest person in the world.[20]

Musk has stated that the goals of SolarCity, Tesla Motors, and SpaceX revolve around his vision to change the world and humanity.[21] His goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and reducing the ""risk of human extinction"" by ""making life multiplanetary""[22][23] by setting up a human colony on Mars.

it appears amber heard has found herself in legal trouble.

according to reports, the actress is being sued for 10 million dollars for her part in an alleged conspiracy to sabotage the drama london fields. 

here’s what’s happening:

a production company – nicola six – which is named after heard’s character in the film, sued amber along with the movie’s director for breach of contract because they refused to shoot the agreed upon script and failed to show up at the toronto international film festival to promote the film. 

the suit reportedly claims that ‘while the inherent tension between actors and directors and producers are nothing new in hollywood, the unauthorized and unlawful acts of heard and others – notably their campaign to the picture and the picture’s investors – are perhaps unprecedented’.

it goes on to allege that heard refused to act in provocative scenes… meaning key scenes in the movie had to be removed or rewritten to accommodate her behavior.

there has been no response from amber.

amber heard is to give her $7 million divorce settlement from johnny depp to a charity that supports victims of domestic violence and a children’s hospital.

heard wrote in a statement released on thursday that the entire settlement would be split between the american civil liberties union (aclu) and the children’s hospital los angeles, with the aclu’s share of $3.5m going specifically towards its efforts to combat violence against women.

she and depp settled their contentious divorce on tuesday, one day before the actors were scheduled to begin a restraining order hearing that would center on heard’s allegations depp repeatedly abused her during their marriage.

depp denied he abused heard, and his attorney alleged she was making the domestic violence allegations to obtain a more favorable settlement.

court filings show heard had initially requested $50,000 a month in spousal support, which was denied by the judge.

i've been meaning to do a #blackcat trailer for a while but nothing seemed to work. she's a favourite #spiderman villain of mine and could easily have her own netflix series thanks to her ties to kingpin and the defenders... after revisiting and revamping, with some new material, i finally managed to complete the project! i hope you like it (and her) as much as i do.

the plot would be:
like in the comics, her father's a master thief. she follows suit and her criminal activity peaks interest from the kingpin. after various cat-and-mouse pursuit that sees her captured, she makes a deal to undergo experimentation (gaining her famous 'bad luck' powers).the finale would see her attempt to bring down the kingpin with these new abilities, regaining her freedom in the process.

kingpin/wilson fisk - vincent d'onofrio
spider-man/peter parker - i only included a costumed clip so it could basically be anybody... we don't need to see his face anyway.

best daily splash news daily celebrity playlist: https://goo.gl/qsxt0r

now we have a better idea about when amber heard will get her divorce settlement from johnny depp.

according to tmz, the pirates of the caribbean star will pay his former love 6.8 million dollars – which is 200,000 dollars short of the agreed upon 7 – because he already donated that couple hundred grand to the aclu and children’s hospital in la. 

and she’ll have possession of the money in 12 months.

rumor has it she’ll still follow through with her vow to donate every penny… shell make multiple payments to chla and aclu… with the plan to pay the full amount by the end of 2018.

but according to the report, sources not connected to amber have a different take. they don’t think the charities will ever get the money… but we’ll obviously have to wait and see.

as for the 200 k johnny donated, he’ll get a charitable tax write-off for that, and amber will write off 6.8 million worth of donations.

hey mgtow brothers
today’s video is a request topic from havier or zavier, depending how you pronounce it, and this is what he says: 

hi mgtow 101, i love your videos and i would like to donate to help you keep up the good fight, and as you said that with anything over $20, you would make a video on request, here you have my topic:

storyline   -----------   the adderall diaries

as a writer stymied by past success, writers block, substance abuse, relationship problems and a serious set of father issues, elliott's cracked-out chronicle of a bizarre murder trial amounts to less than the sum of its parts. not long into the 2007 trial of programmer hans reiser, accused of murdering his wife, the defendant's friend sean sturgeon obliquely confessed to several murders (though not the murder of reiser's wife). elliott, caught up in the film-ready twist and his tenuous connection to sturgeon (they share a bdsm social circle), makes a gonzo record of the proceedings. the result is a scattered, self-indulgent romp through the mind of a depressive narcissist obsessed with his insecurities and childhood traumas.

Storyline   -----------   THE ADDERALL DIARIES

As a writer stymied by past success, writers block, substance abuse, relationship problems and a serious set of father issues, Elliott's cracked-out chronicle of a bizarre murder trial amounts to less than the sum of its parts. Not long into the 2007 trial of programmer Hans Reiser, accused of murdering his wife, the defendant's friend Sean Sturgeon obliquely confessed to several murders (though not the murder of Reiser's wife). Elliott, caught up in the film-ready twist and his tenuous connection to Sturgeon (they share a BDSM social circle), makes a gonzo record of the proceedings. The result is a scattered, self-indulgent romp through the mind of a depressive narcissist obsessed with his insecurities and childhood traumas.

the first picture of amber heard in justice league has been released.

amber, 30, will play mera queen of atlantis in the new dc comics superhero flick.


not only does she get to be in charge of a watery kingdom, she’s also the on-screen wife of jason momoa’s aquaman.

the film also stars ben affleck as batman, henry cavill as superman, gal gadot as wonder woman, ezra fisher as the flash, ray fisher as cyborg, and j.k. simmons as commissioner gordon.

while it’s thought amber will have just a supporting role in justice league, she’s expected to feature more prominently in 2018’s standalone aquaman movie, which will be directed by james wan – the brains behind saw, insidious, the conjuring and furious 7.

mera first appeared in aquaman no. 11 back in 1963, but it wasn’t until 2009 she was made more of a main player in the dc universe.

the innovation engine: a look inside emc’s emerging technologies division | #emcworld

by amber johnson | may 4, 2016

within every company lives the driving edge of its future product line. for emc, this division is called the emerging technologies division (etd). sam grocott, svp of marketing and product management at emc’s etd, explained that his division is mostly comprised of 1.0 or 2.0 products, with the exception of the isilon business unit, which is on its 8th generation.

grocott explained that etd exists within emc to orchestrate the opportunity for two things: innovation and growth. “that’s what we are judged on; it’s what we are measured against,” he said. grocott sat down with john furrier (@furrier) and dave vellante (@dvellante), cohosts of thecube, from siliconangle media team, during emc world 2016 in las vegas.

grocott mentioned emc’s dssd products, scaleio, elastic cloud storage (ecs), vipr, and the new vce vxrack system 1000 with neutrino nodes (announced may 3) as part of etd’s enterprise product repertoire. he also called etd’s product line “a family of four products”: vipr controller, ecs software-defined object storage system, scaleio software-defined block storage system, and isilonsd edge.

making vipr simpler

when asked about vipr’s initial release, grocott stated, “we confused the market,” but “we heard the feedback from customers. … we tried to glom too much into the vipr system, so what we decided to do was make it simpler.” etd focused vipr on the “controller aspect” and open-sourced the core ip in project coprhd (copperhead).

emc announced on may 2 it would release vipr 3.0, which will feature all of copperhead’s “up to 50 different arrays of storage,” according to grocott. thus, etd has worked toward “a truly heterogeneous environment.” grocott remarked that “simplification, automation, ease of use” is “absolutely what vipr is focused on.”",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QkuPTo2gEE/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QkuPTo2gEE/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QkuPTo2gEE/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QkuPTo2gEE/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QkuPTo2gEE/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,SiliconANGLE theCUBE,"['theCUBE', 'Sam Grocott', 'Dave Vellante', 'EMC', 'EMC World', 'John Furrier', '@theCUBE', '#theCUBE', '@siliconangle', '#SiliconANGLE', 'SiliconANGLE', 'Science News', 'Technology', 'Tech News', 'Business News and General Info', 'Dell EMC', '@DellEMC', '@DellTech', 'Dell Technology', '#DellEMC', '#EMC']",28,none,"Sam Grocott, EMC | EMC World 2016","Enhanced video at http://vinja.tv/qNDpZxW5

Within every company lives the driving edge of its future product line. For EMC, this division is called the Emerging Technologies Division (ETD). Sam Grocott, SVP of marketing and product management at EMC’s ETD, explained that his division is mostly comprised of 1.0 or 2.0 products, with the exception of the Isilon Business Unit, which is on its 8th generation.

Grocott explained that ETD exists within EMC to orchestrate the opportunity for two things: innovation and growth. “That’s what we are judged on; it’s what we are measured against,” he said. Grocott sat down with John Furrier (@furrier) and Dave Vellante (@dvellante), cohosts of theCUBE, from SiliconANGLE Media team, during EMC World 2016 in Las Vegas.

Grocott mentioned EMC’s DSSD products, ScaleIO, Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), ViPR, and the new VCE VxRack System 1000 with Neutrino Nodes (announced May 3) as part of ETD’s enterprise product repertoire. He also called ETD’s product line “a family of four products”: ViPR Controller, ECS software-defined object storage system, ScaleIO software-defined block storage system, and IsilonSD Edge.

according to inside sources, depp agreed to pay heard $7 million, including attorneys’ fees, to dismiss the case.

did amber heard seriously think no one would look into this? 

remember when amber made a statement saying that she would donate the $7 million dollars she won in her divorce settlement with johnny depp to children’s hospital and the aclu? well according to tmz, the charities haven’t seen a dime. 

in more than 3 months, amber is still apparently sitting on the money… 

but honestly, if donations to these charities are traceable, then amber can’t be so stupid as to believe no one would double check her offers? right? there’s no way. 

according to tmz, the final settlement documents haven’t been signed yet, so maybe amber doesn’t have the funds to donate yet. 

also, depp reportedly said that he wanted to donate the funds to the charities for her, but she’s trying to prohibit that because she doesn’t want him to get the tax reduction. 

regardless, things remain messy between amber and johnny, but hopefully charities won’t have to lose out because of it.

Did Amber Heard seriously think no one would look into this? 

Remember when Amber made a statement saying that she would donate the $7 million dollars she won in her divorce settlement with Johnny Depp to Children’s Hospital and the ACLU? Well according to TMZ, the charities haven’t seen a dime. 

In more than 3 months, Amber is still apparently sitting on the money… 

But honestly, if donations to these charities are traceable, then Amber can’t be so stupid as to believe no one would double check her offers? Right? There’s no way. 

According to TMZ, the final settlement documents haven’t been signed yet, so maybe Amber doesn’t have the funds to donate yet. 

Also, Depp reportedly said that he wanted to donate the funds to the charities for her, but she’s trying to prohibit that because she doesn’t want him to get the tax reduction. 

Regardless, things remain messy between Amber and Johnny, but hopefully charities won’t have to lose out because of it.

hi this is ryan with screen rant’s featured news of the day.

aquaman officially has his queen.

you may have heard the rumors back in january about who the role of aquaman’s wife mera, was being given to - and we now have confirmation that the casting rumors we heard are true.. ya heard? ok if you haven’t figured it out yet, the role has been given to amber heard. amber heard.

the actress made the confirmation herself during an interview with entertainment tonight-- while promoting her film the adderall diaries--

and even gave a little tease of what her costume will be like.

so half-armor and half-scales huh--- we had an artist put together a rendition of what that will look like…

and oh wow, that looks awful.

the character of mera has the same strength and endurance as aquaman, but instead of dealing with sea life, she deals with water itself and is able to bend it to her will..

but seriously, it’s a hardcore power. if she wanted to, she could evaporate all the water out of a human body. imagine that. you’d be so thirsty.

the 30-year-old starlet is reportedly ""spending time"" with the mogul behind tesla motors and spacex, tmz reported thursday.

musk, who is also going through a divorce, and heard have apparently been friends for years and have been seeing each other more in the last few months, according to the gossip site.

two weeks ago they allegedly enjoyed a dinner date and last weekend, heard and her sister hung out in musk's hotel in miami.

reps for the stars did not immediately return the news request for comment.

heard filed for divorce from the ""pirates of the caribbean star"" in late may — three days after his mom, betty sue palmer, died.

four days later, the ""danish girl"" star appeared in court bearing a visible bruise on her face and alleged a history of domestic abuse throughout their 15 month marriage.

she was granted a temporary restraining order against the actor.

meanwhile, musk's wife, actress talulah riley, filed for divorce in late march. riley had first filed to end the marriage in 2012 but the rocky pair remarried in 2013.

a year later, it was musk,45, who wanted out, filing for divorce on new year's eve 2014. the papers were dismissed six months later.

amber and elon have been friends for several years, according to tmz, but since her split with johnny, “they’ve been spending a lot of time together.”


“just last weekend, amber and her sister were hanging out in elon’s hotel bungalow in miami. she had a 1-on-1 dinner at his l.a. house 2 weeks ago. she recently went to elon’s l.a. area office to spend time with him. and he’s paid several visits to her home,” a source told the news site.

at this time, no one in amber’s circle is calling it “dating,” but their extra time together seems super suspicious.

interestingly, elon is also going through a divorce. his ex filed in march after they got married for a second time. elon is worth an estimated $12.7 billion.

amber heard will return from her week-long trip to london before her deposition on at 10 a.m. on saturday (aug. 6, 2016).

tmz reports that johnny depp’s lawyer plan to “grill” heard on her claims of physical abuse against her estranged husband with inquiries in reference to statements from police and witnesses who allege that she showed no signs of injury and that the condition of her los angeles loft did not indicate that there had been a physical fight.

both parties would have to sign off to allow depp to be physically present at the deposition given the active restraining order that has been placed against him. sources tell tmz that heard’s lawyer “will not object” to depp being at the table.

depp will have to attend his own deposition next week and, according to tmz’s sources, settlement discussions are ongoing.

TMZ reports that Johnny Depp’s lawyer plan to “grill” heard on her claims of physical abuse against her estranged husband with inquiries in reference to statements from police and witnesses who allege that she showed no signs of injury and that the condition of her Los Angeles loft did not indicate that there had been a physical fight.

Both parties would have to sign off to allow Depp to be physically present at the deposition given the active restraining order that has been placed against him. Sources tell TMZ that Heard’s lawyer “will not object” to Depp being at the table.

Depp will have to attend his own deposition next week and, according to TMZ’s sources, settlement discussions are ongoing.

amber heard, who has filed for divorce from actor johnny depp and accused him of domestic violence, has released fresh photos which allegedly depict past incidents of abuse by the hollywood superstar, reported people magazine. 

the 30-year-old actress sports a cut lip and seemingly bruised eye in the new photos. the injuries were allegedly inflicted by depp, 52, in december 2015.

Amber Heard, who has filed for divorce from actor Johnny Depp and accused him of domestic violence, has released fresh photos which allegedly depict past incidents of abuse by the Hollywood superstar, reported People magazine. 

The 30-year-old actress sports a cut lip and seemingly bruised eye in the new photos. The injuries were allegedly inflicted by Depp, 52, in December 2015. 

Ms Heard has got a restraining order against the actor and claimed that besides the latest incident of violence on April 21, the actor was violent to him in the past as well. 

In documents filed on May 27 to seek a temporary restraining order against Ms Depp, Ms Heard had alleged that during the ""entirety"" of their four-year relationship, ""Mr Depp has been verbally and physically abusive to me."" 

She described a December event that possibly correlates with the alleged timeline of these new photos.

amber heard isn’t giving up her fight against johnny depp.

and her legal team is claiming johnny has not held up his end of the bargain.

according to new documents that were obtained by e! news, heard’s attorneys say the 53-year-old actors failed to pay the first two installments of their seven figure settlement as well as neglecting to transfer the title to their range rover into her name as well as the division of personal property.

she’s also requested that her legal fees – totaling a little over 35 thousand dollars – be taken care of.

in the docs, heard wrote a written declaration regarding johnny’s decision to try to give the money to a charity instead of her. she also wrote that he claimed she violated the confidentiality provisions of the deal point memorandum by announcing that she would be donating her settlement to charities. she also points out that she made those donations in good faith and was responding to the leaks by johnny’s agents bragging that she settled for substantially less than an earlier offer sum and attempting to label her as a gold digger. 

heard and depp announced their divorce back in may after reports claim the star was physically abusive.

News, Heard’s attorneys say the 53-year-old actors failed to pay the first two installments of their seven figure settlement as well as neglecting to transfer the title to their Range Rover into her name as well as the division of personal property.

She’s also requested that her legal fees – totaling a little over 35 thousand dollars – be taken care of.

In the docs, Heard wrote a written declaration regarding Johnny’s decision to try to give the money to a charity instead of her. She also wrote that he claimed she violated the confidentiality provisions of the Deal Point Memorandum by announcing that she would be donating her settlement to charities. She also points out that she made those donations in good faith and was responding to the leaks by Johnny’s agents bragging that she settled for substantially less than an earlier offer sum and attempting to label her as a gold digger. 

Heard and Depp announced their divorce back in May after reports claim the star was physically abusive.
