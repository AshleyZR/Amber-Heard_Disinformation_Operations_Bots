I had a bit of a panic when after I posted it was only playing through one of my headphones and I made the video private before I realized it was just my headphones and not the audio of the video. Doing this may mess with being able to access the video through the notification link so I just wanted to fill you guys in, in case it wasn't working. I would have just reposted it to make sure but I spent a substantial amount of time manually putting in subtitles via the YouTube creator studio so I was going to have to re-do it and I was so not into that.\n\ncheck out my new song \"CANCER\" here!\ud83d\udc49 https://youtu.be/-EoF4OcmXdY",
