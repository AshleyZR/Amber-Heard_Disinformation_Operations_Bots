So today I'm gonna show you how to find Shitzu\u00a0Hakuchou in Gta 5 Story Mode(offline) with the spawn locations and other random locations that you can find these motorcycles. This Motorcycle is not able to purchase in the story mode and only can be stolen to aquire one.\n\nYou'll find almost everything you need to know upto date because im playing on the one of the latest version which is 2372 build, 1.57 online (1.58 is the most recent one) and i can ensure that these locations and methods are working across most of the platforms including ps5, ps4, xbox one, xbox series x and pc(which im demonstrating). If you're a returning player on ps3 and xbox 360, you'll also be able to find these motorcycles.\n\n\u25baLeaving a LIKE would always appreciate! \n\u25baSubscribe for latest video uploads! http://bit.ly/29ZRld9\n\nOur social media:\n\u25fdLike on Facebook: http://bit.ly/2acp9pO\n\u25fdFollow on Twitter: http://bit.ly/6zco6Xb\n\u25fdMessage on Hangouts: Redux Dreams Lab\n\nThanks for watching and see you back!",
