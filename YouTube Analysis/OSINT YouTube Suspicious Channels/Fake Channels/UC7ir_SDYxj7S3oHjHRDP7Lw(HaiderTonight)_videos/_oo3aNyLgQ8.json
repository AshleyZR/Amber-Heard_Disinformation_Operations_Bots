This song brings a lot of cool memories from 2006, and I am pretty sure a lot of you will also find this song nostalgic as it was a part of WWE's Smackdown vs Raw (2007) game soundtrack, and it's such a good song with catchy vocal lines, and awesome riffs, so I thought it would be cool to start with this one, and I hope you'll like it as much as I loved playing it, folks.
