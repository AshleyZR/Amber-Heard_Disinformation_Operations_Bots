In this vlog, I attempt to attain a Billie Eilish look by dying my brown hair blue with Manic Panic \"After Midnight\" semi-permanent hair dye! No bleach was involved in the making of this video. If your hair is light enough, Manic Panic hair dye can be a great option if you are worried about damaging your hair.
